## Goals

Conduct a discourse analysis on the Dungeons & Dragons liveplay podcasts Critical Role and Dimension 20. 
This is intended to include investigations into gender and dyanmic (Dungeon Master and player) differences in speech length,
amount of speech, turn-taking, interruptions (vs crosstalk), and hedging. 

Critical Role is a podcast lead by Dungeon Master Matt Mercer and played by a cast of 7 players (3 women, 4 men) with some guests appearing throughout.
Dimension 20 has a rotating cast of players and Dungeon Masters, the seasons we will be looking at are lead by Dungeon Master Aabira Iyengar.
With these two sets of data we can explore and analyze our speech among different dynamics, one show lead and narrated by a man, and one by a woman. 

The stages of my plan (for now) are:
1. Process data into useful dataframes with speech and ID information included
2. Pre-treat data to eliminate any non-speech elements and organize for more clean analysis
3. My datasets aren't exactly even to one another, so I plan to investigate them in proportions (% of DM speak vs % of player speak, etc)
4. 
5.
