This is anachronistic intentionally. Like,": null, "we are living in like a sort of Medieval high-fantasy world, and then": null, "there's just this interesting shift that feels a little out of time,": null, "which is strange to note but not uncomfortable, because you all live and": null, "exist in a plane and a world that's sort of disentangled from the": null, "mundanities of linear time.": null, "Emily: I guess I knock on the radiator.": null, "Chirp: [clears throat] Hello!": null, "[knocking resounds]": null, "BINX: Oh, hello, hi.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Hi.": null, "Surena: I pop up out, hello.": null, "BINX: Thank you so much for coming.

I never even thought about doing that. You're a": null, "genius. Quite honestly, you might be the smartest person at the Bloom. I": null, "don't want to say that, like, to just say it, but like, that's": null, "incredible, your mind.": null, "Chirp: Thank you, you know, it's not really something I ever really": null, "think about that much, yeah, well\u2014": null, "BINX:\u00a0But come in, come in, come in!": null, "Chirp: Yes, yes, absolutely.": null, "Surena: And so you come in to what looks like an antique museum full of": null, "many\u2014": null, "Chirp: [gasps] Is this an estate sale?

It's all from the mortal realm, most of it.": null, "Some of it's from Avernus and other places, other planes.": null, "Chirp: Yes, yes, I suppose maybe we should talk about what I did not": null, "know previously, that you were Lady Gwyndolin and BINX in one.

The entire ball was a lot.": null, "Chirp: Yeah.": null, "BINX: But there's something about you that is so interesting to me, and": null, "as soon as you said a place that I recognized I was like, \"That's it.\"": null, "And I think that once you, any Fey goes to the mortal realm we are like,": null, "changed, forever changed. And I felt that in you. I felt that you were": null, "different.": null, "Chirp: Yes, I would certainly say that the mortal plane can have its own": null, "bewitching effect. I would say that the bewitching-ness goes both ways.": null, "When the mortal plane comes here, they find themselves fascinated, and": null, "when we go there, we find they have their own magic.": null, "BINX: Yes, I'm gonna get very straightforward with you right now.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, bring it on.": null, "BINX: If you visit the mortal realm, if that's something that you": null, "frequent, I've been working with Gwyndolin. Gwyndolin is a real person.": null, "I don't know if you knew that. She's not dead. She didn't die. I didn't": null, "murder her.": null, "Chirp: Okay, so when you... Okay, now you just gave me a bunch of": null, "specifics and I feel like you did.": null, "BINX: She's not dead. She's definitely fine.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: Ooh, you gotta, Insight, Insight.": null, "Emily: Okay, Insight. That's a 4.": null, "Aabria: 4.\u00a0Against your Persuasion or Deception, I don't know which.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Persuasion!": null, "Aabria: Did you kill her?": null, "Surena: She's fine.

Thank you so much for spelling it out. All the": null, "permutations in which she could be harmed and the fact that you haven't": null, "done them to her.": null, "BINX: Of course.": null, "Chirp: I do appreciate that sort of thoroughness.": null, "BINX: Well, I feel like if you say something like that, like as specific": null, "as possible, it must mean it's true.": null, "Chirp: It's like how me and Cousin keep being like, \"Grandfather\" and": null, "everyone thinks that means he's dead.": null, "BINX: Right, he's not dead. He's just in the sky, right?": null, "Chirp: He's not. He's just in the sky. Except right now I believe he": null, "spent the night somewhere else but...": null, "BINX: Oh, oh.": null, "Chirp: Yeah. But I'm sorry, back to what you were saying.": null, "BINX: Right, right, right, sorry. Yes. I've been working with Gwyndolin.": null, "Gwyndolin also frequents the mortal plane. And portals have been": null, "closing. And when a portal closes, it's unpredictable when one will open": null, "again and where it will open.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Hm.": null, "BINX: The only reason I was able to get around it, it was because I": null, "found a loophole. And that helps me kind of gain magic from the mortal": null, "realm as well as bring my magic to it.": null, "Chirp: Okay, so both of us have a vested interest in keeping passage to": null, "the material plane open. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.": null, "Emily: I guess can I do some kind of... What the fuck would I do to": null, "even... I think, you know what?": null, "Chirp: You've given me information that if you were to try to cross me,": null, "I now have something on you, so I will just tell you exactly what I": null, "know. I don't know the details of how they're doing it yet, but the": null, "closing of portals, I believe, is the work of the Unseelie Court.": null, "BINX: Oh.": null, "Chirp: My cousin and I recently came into such information and have": null, "been... [clears throat] I've been stringing along Suntar.": null, "Chirp: For a political alliance. At first I thought, \u201cOkay, maybe this": null, "is great. She offered me a loveless political marriage. Great, that's": null, "honestly what I'm here for.\u201d Uh, but I... Once I learned their": null, "intentions, I've decided to maintain the relationship in order to learn": null, "precisely how the Unseelie Court is doing this so that it may be undone.": null, "So if you are concerned about the closing of the portals, I share your": null, "concern and I have every intention of finding out exactly what the": null, "Unseelie Court is up to. So if you would like to be of help in that...": null, "BINX: And like, friends and stuff? Yeah\u2014": null, "Chirp: You've already\u2014I was gonna call you Gwyndolin. BINX, you've": null, "already been over for tea.": null, "BINX: That's true!": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yes.": null, "BINX: Yes, okay.": null, "Chirp: [laughs] So yes. We are absolutely.": null, "BINX:\u00a0All right.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, so I mean, if you would like to be involved, you seem to be": null, "spectacularly deceptive and slippery. I would imagine that you would": null, "make a very good ally in such information seeking.": null, "BINX: Yes, you know, to be completely candid, I wasn't sure about the": null, "Unseelie Court. I heard maybe that was something, but Andhera seems like": null, "he wouldn't have anything to do with that, but what if he's lying? What": null, "if that's not true?": null, "Chirp: Oh, oh BINX. I didn't mean to try to complicate your relationship": null, "or anything.": null, "BINX: No, no, I'm just\u2014I'm just thinking out loud, yeah.": null, "Chirp: I learned it from Suntar and Prince Apollo.": null, "BINX: Prince Apollo. He's a dirtbag, right?": null, "[Aabria snickers]": null, "Chirp: Yeah, I just really can't get a read on him, right?": null, "BINX: Yeah, I just like\u2014when I look at him I'm just like, I don't know": null, "what your deal is, but I don't like it, yeah.": null, "Chirp: Yes, yeah. But he's really forthcoming.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Right, like, he's never said anything bad.": null, "Chirp: I think I like him more than Suntar, if I'm being honest.": null, "BINX: Really? I've never had a conversation with Suntar before.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, this was my first one.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Oh, not a fan?": null, "Chirp: This was my first one and it was, well, we entered potentially a": null, "political loveless marriage.": null, "BINX: Oh, oh my God, yeah.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yeah, I know. Big, big, very big.": null, "BINX: Yeah.": null, "Chirp: So yes, so I mean, my plan is to maybe just speak with her and": null, "see if she'll be forthcoming with me.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Okay. Great.": null, "Chirp: Feign like I love her idea.": null, "BINX: Ooh.": null, "Chirp: And see if she wants the help of the Lords of the Wing in her": null, "endeavor, and thereby kind of learn what the nature of their closing the": null, "portals is.": null, "BINX: Love that. How do you lie without becoming sleepy?": null, "[Aabria chuckles]": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Oh...": null, "BINX: Like, lie, like, straight lie without becoming incredibly drowsy.": null, "How do you do that?": null, "Chirp: So I'm the Countess of Cluckingham, and the people of": null, "Cluckingham, espionage, intelligence-gathering, it's our shit. I think": null, "I've been lying since I was a child, which I guess everyone goes through": null, "a lying phase when they're a child, but we never get out of it.": null, "BINX: Got it.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "BINX: Yeah, I can't actually lie without passing out.": null, "Chirp: Passing out?": null, "BINX:\u00a0Yeah, well, it depends on the severity of the lie. If it's like a": null, "small one, I just get a little tired.": null, "Chirp: So just physically taking on a different form you can do?": null, "BINX: Well, when I'm Gwyndolin, I'm Gwyndolin.": null, "Chirp: Oh, okay. Oh, method actor, love it.": null, "Brennan: You know, there's a movie coming out...": null, "Surena: Really? [laughs]": null, "Lou: Hey, will you read these sides?": null, "Lou: It's only two lines.": null, "Oscar: We're\u00a0looking for an ambulance.": null, "Brennan: I'm looking for an ambulance!": null, "Emily: Pretend like you have a wound that you just won't cover.": null, "Lou: Yes, and a flask of genuine Scotch that's heavy in your pocket.": null, "[gentle piano music]": null, "BINX: But I, um, consider me an ally in this.": null, "Chirp: Yes, absolutely.": null, "BINX: Yeah. We'll figure it out and I'll tell you what I know. And we": null, "can make sure that we can have access to the place that we care so": null, "deeply about.": null, "Chirp: You seem to really, really care about the material plane and its": null, "people.": null, "BINX: I do.": null, "Chirp: I find it very interesting because when it comes to humans, how": null, "do I put this? Don't mistake their innocence of means for an innocence": null, "of heart.": null, "BINX: Oh yeah, some humans are trash, right?": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yeah, yeah.": null, "BINX: Like, so terrible.": null, "Chirp: I just wanted to make sure if you really wanted to give magic to": null, "everyone that like, there are some people it can be a really corrupting": null, "force for.": null, "BINX: Yeah, I just... It's not even that I want to give magic to": null, "everyone there. It's more of, everyone should have the potential of": null, "magic. And I think that everyone should have access to what we have": null, "should they want it, should they earn it. And I'm honestly afraid, the": null, "fate of all of us if all portals to the mortal plane are closed\u2026 I don't": null, "know what the consequences will be. I just know that when we get": null, "stuck... Oh, I should tell you this. Side note. If you get trapped in": null, "the mortal plane, like, if you can't find your way back, you turn into": null, "stuff.": null, "Chirp: What?": null, "BINX: So it depends on where you, you know, reside the longest. And it\u2019s": null, "not\u2014it has to be for a long time, but the last weaver of the Court of": null, "Wonder, he turned into a tree. A very nice tree.

I haven't floated the idea yet, yeah.": null, "BINX: Okay, let me know how... What's your deal with your brother, I": null, "mean, your cousin?": null, "Chirp:\u00a0What's the deal with him?": null, "Chirp: He's the best. He's the greatest..": null, "BINX:\u00a0Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Chirp: He's the coolest. He's the hippest.

I love watching it.": null, "BINX: Right? Like, he just like, does what he wants.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yeah, he's great, yeah.": null, "BINX: Cool, awesome, all right.": null, "Chirp: All right. Well yes, I will be in touch with you whenever I have": null, "my tandem bike ride.": null, "BINX: Thank you.": null, "Surena: And I'm gonna give them the one item I found in Hanivan is a": null, "brooch, and it's a beetle brooch.

Or do you just do the": null, "things that need to be done?": null, "Wuvvy: I don't know if I know the difference all the time.": null, "Rue: Well, let me ask you this. Do you find joy in running around and": null, "doing errands for other people?": null, "Wuvvy: Not everyone, but for you, yes.": null, "Rue: Wuvvy, I have one errand to ask of you.": null, "Wuvvy:\u00a0Hm.": null, "Rue: For the event tomorrow or whatever happens tomorrow, I want you to": null, "trust the smaller Fey that they will do the job that you appointed them.": null, "I don't want you to run around. I don't want you to do any of the tasks.": null, "And I just want you to exist in the space.": null, "Wuvvy: Why?": null, "Rue: Well, because a good friend of mine, Lady Featherfowl, gave me some": null, "great advice. She told me that I should just exist and be present in the": null, "moment, and I allowed that to happen at the ball and it was one of the": null, "most magical experiences I've ever had, and I'm afraid that you are": null, "bound by obligation and not love.": null, "[soft instrumental music]": null, "Wuvvy: For me, I think the thing I love and that which I have a duty": null, "toward are very much one and the same. And I've noticed that I think": null, "that's not necessarily true for you. That's okay. If you tell me to step": null, "back from the next event, I will do it, but I won't enjoy it. I like": null, "helping you create, execute on your vision. It pleases me greatly to be": null, "of use to you. And maybe that's not true forever, but it's true right": null, "now. All I want is what's... I'm sorry, were you saying something?": null, "Rue: No.": null, "Oscar: And I think I'm starting to realize that there's a rift, a big": null, "divide between Wuvvy and myself in terms of our goals and what we want.": null, "Rue: [sighs] I... You know that there are no secrets between us. And I": null, "must confess something to you, Wuvvy. Something unexpected, something": null, "that I would have never expected to happen in a millennia, but something": null, "has taken precedent over doing my obligations in the Bloom.

I was just gonna send a kinda thirsty,": null, "nasty letter, kinda my general.": null, "Squak:\u00a0You know how I do like, kind of a Mad Libs thing.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Where all my letters are the same and I just fill in different": null, "specifics.": null, "Squak:\u00a0So it's gonna be one of those for Prince Apollo.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, but not for Theodore. Not for the other\u2014": null, "Squak: Well, Theodore got a specific one 'cause we were kind of getting": null, "the setup, and I think after, you know, he'll probably get one of these": null, "down the line.

We see nothing wrong with what you've": null, "done.": null, "Rue: And what about the rumors that the Court of Wonder is keeping a lot": null, "of the magic resources and its relation to the Court of Craft? Are those": null, "rumors as well?": null, "Chorus: Of course. People are wont to talk. We regret the dissolution of": null, "the Court of Craft. That is beyond our control and beneath our sights.": null, "They were our sister, yes. But we are holders of vastly different realms": null, "of power and portfolios. We regret deeply that we did not see what was": null, "coming and intervene, but what is done is done, and people talk.": null, "Rue: And what about the rumor that this is indeed the last Bloom?

Your insights, your knowledge, your": null, "gifts, your talents are wondrous to us. We love them and you.": null, "Rue: This is... And what of the Bloom? If I join the Chorus I must give": null, "up the title of Master of Ceremony.": null, "Chorus: You have trained a worthy replacement, have you not?": null, "Rue: In Wuvvy, yes.": null, "Chorus: In Wuvvy, yes. Is it not her time to shine?": null, "Surena: [inhales deeply] Ooh.": null, "Rue: I have been debating relenting my position as the Master of": null, "Ceremony. That regardless of whether this is the last Bloom or not, I": null, "will no longer be the Master of Ceremony. If you remember, I made a": null, "wager with the Lords of the Wing.

It is your title, but is it": null, "yours to give?": null, "Rue: I understand that. I understand that. But why must the Court of": null, "Wonder hold the title, Master of Ceremony? Why must we hold on to the": null, "magic that controls the Bloom?": null, "Chorus: Who better than us?": null, "Rue: Does this practice not coincide with the idea of the Bloom to": null, "co-mingle, come together, exchange experiences between courts? When we": null, "are apart from the Bloom, all the other courts stay together. That is": null, "why I love making events for the Bloom. The reason that I do the Bloom,": null, "that I have done the Bloom was for love, was for people of different": null, "courts to come together and find true love so they can intermingle, and": null, "hopefully one day maybe banish the thought of courts.": null, "[Brennan and Surena gasp] [Surena and Brennan cheer boisterously]": null, "The first event, the Hart Hunt, do you not see the implication?

And I'm not gonna fumble the": null, "bag so close to victory.": null, "Chirp: Of course.": null, "Squak: That's fair. I mean, again, our grandfather invented birds. We": null, "know the power.": null, "Suntar: My mother invented darkness.": null, "[Surena groans]": null, "Squak: Listen, I didn't mean it as a pissing contest. I meant it more as": null, "that we understand the depths of the implications that decisions made by": null, "a court of true power such as ours can have.

It's your call.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: But between the two of you, you can give it to me with": null, "advantage. She is not immune to flattery.": null, "Lou: That's one.

You see a young woman sort of rigid in her posture doing her": null, "best approximation of the countenance of her mother.

[inhales softly] Well, [chuckles softly] let your": null, "grandfather know, in addition to both Apollo and my's greetings and": null, "salutations, that we will have one chance to put something into the": null, "world, enough to sustain the mortals and let them make their own way,": null, "but magic is our gift.

By the end of the": null, "week, there's a play in the works, and we would be honored if you sat": null, "with us as a show of unity and strength in our box at it.": null, "Chirp: That would be fantastic.": null, "Squak: It's certainly such a prized position.": null, "Chirp: I know, your box has A/C.

There's no nastiness there. Zero nastiness.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Oh, that's true.": null, "Squak: I just kind of saw\u2014": null, "Chirp: No, it was great.

Let's cut to Major Hob.": null, "Brennan: I leave my tent.

We all saw what we saw.": null, "Blemish/Boil: Someone near to you?": null, "Major Hob: Hm?": null, "[ominous music]": null, "Oscar: Oh!": null, "Surena: Uh...": null, "Blemish/Boil: Near to you?": null, "Major Hob: Physically, someone close by, within arm's reach, proximity,": null, "spatial\u2014": null, "Aabria: Deception check!": null, "Oscar: Oh no!": null, "Surena: Yikes, yikes.": null, "Brennan: No!

As": null, "you've said, I'm a blunt instrument. My head is full of rocks and my": null, "heart of garbage.": null, "Blemish/Boil: Yes, yes, yes, yes. You also, please don't yell.": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Sorry!": null, "Blemish/Boil: Did you not drink? Ugh!": null, "Major Hob: I am sorry. Who would ever love me, you know?

I know that my booming voice is bad": null, "when you've been drinking. The Viscountess has marriage well in hand. In": null, "terms of the rumor of an assassin or agent saboteur amongst the Court of": null, "Wonder, this is... On my end those ends have come up dry. I don't know": null, "if you've found anything. Is it perhaps time that we dismiss this as": null, "nothing more than a rumor? Or is this a lead you still wish for me to": null, "pursue?": null, "Blemish/Boil: We are still here for a little while longer. Are you so": null, "derelict in your duty that you would like to risk our wellbeing by": null, "moving on?": null, "Major Hob: No, no, I'll keep an eye out for that assassin.": null, "Major Hob: The insult paid to our court by Prince Apollo during the": null, "hedge maze.": null, "Blemish/Boil: Yes.": null, "Major Hob: I have confirmed with the Lords of the Wing that the mistaken": null, "understanding was deposited in the mind of Lord Airavis by Prince Apollo": null, "himself. Does our honor require satisfaction?": null, "Aabria: [sighs] And you see Lord Blemish takes a couple deep breaths,": null, "sort of calming down that like, bloodlust that you see sort of coming up": null, "behind their bloodshot eyes.": null, "Blemish: We demand satisfaction.": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Very well, I shall\u2014": null, "Blemish: Bring us his head.": null, "Major Hob: I will attempt to, in offering a gentleman's slap to initiate": null, "the duel, I will attempt to decapitate him in that moment.": null, "Blemish: Very good.": null, "Major Hob: Finally, or rather second to last, I only meant to ask, in": null, "your note of my new assignment.": null, "Blemish/Boil:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Major Hob: [inhales and exhales softly] You made mention of the Unseelie": null, "working alongside the Court of Wonder. The Prince Andhera and I have": null, "become sparring partners, and the young royal, I would consider... There": null, "is a possibility that there may be a friendly ear to the Goblin Court": null, "within the Unseelie.": null, "Major Hob: Is there any utility in approaching His Highness if we worry": null, "that the Unseelie Court is conspiring against us? Is there any": null, "usefulness to the Lord and Lady in perhaps procuring a rise in station": null, "for the young prince over perhaps his sister?": null, "Blemish/Boil: Go on.": null, "Major Hob: I simply mean to say that I talked with the boy, the man. I": null, "know him, and if there is some aid I might provide him that would see": null, "him rise to succeed his mother, the Queen of Air and Darkness, that": null, "perhaps such an arrangement within the Unseelie Court would be": null, "advantageous to prevent an alliance between the Unseelie and the Court": null, "of Wonder. I do not think it is unnoticed by some here at the Bloom that": null, "the young prince may indeed have eyes for the ruler of a court perhaps": null, "more favorable to us.": null, "Blemish/Boil: The Court of Craft.": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Precisely, Lord and Lady.": null, "Blemish/Boil: You've been hard at work, haven't you?": null, "Major Hob: [snaps fingers and claps hands] You know it.": null, "[players chuckle]": null, "Blemish/Boil: Okay. Sure, if you see an opportunity, we trust you to": null, "take it. Do you have anything else to say about our little note? Are you": null, "amenable to the union, Major?": null, "Major Hob: Uh, what matters the amenability of a soldier? You have given": null, "me my orders.": null, "Blemish/Boil: Perhaps we were too harsh. You are no mere soldier.": null, "Major Hob: Oh? What, pray tell, then am I, Your Lord and Ladyship?": null, "Aabria: And you see them, the gears are turning. This... Give me an": null, "Insight check.": null, "Brennan: That is an 11.": null, "Aabria: They look back and forth between themselves, kind of give you a": null, "little nod.": null, "Blemish/Boil: You are like us, important and a little different, but so": null, "valuable to our court.": null, "Major Hob: [exhales deeply] You honor me. All I have ever wished to be": null, "is of service. And to rumpus and ruin, and to\u2014yes.": null, "Blemish/Boil: Yeah, yes, yes, yes, rumpus, ruin, yes. It gets loud every": null, "time. [sighs] We will leave you to it then. And if you perform your": null, "duty, then we will have nothing to say with whatever other activities": null, "fill your time here.": null, "Major Hob: Very well. I aim only to serve. I make one request, if I may,": null, "in accepting the role of major.": null, "Major Hob: In my years of service to come, I would ask that the Lord and": null, "Lady communicate to His Majesty, the Goblin King that I must decline all": null, "future rewardings of any medals of valor or courage.": null, "Blemish/Boil: Why? Sorry, no, why?": null, "Major Hob: I would consider it that the Lord and Lady command that": null, "knowledge as a matter of military order, do they ask it as Goblins like": null, "us. And as a Goblin like you, My Lady, I must invoke the rule of": null, "sneakery. My business is my own.": null, "[Aabria laughs mischievously]": null, "Blemish/Boil: Ah, okay.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Uh, I\u2014": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna move to the stable to go and meet BINX. I walk into": null, "the stable.": null, "[sorrowful piano music]": null, "Brennan: [sobs softly] And I put my hand up on a horse and I go,": null, "Captain Hob: Well, dear old Wrackingspelt.": null, "Surena: Aw, aw.": null, "Captain Hob: Wonderful news. I've fallen in love.": null, "Aabria: Oh. Wrackingspelt nuzzles your hand, yeah.": null, "Brennan: I pet my wonderful horse, and I ride off to the tailor's shop.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, let's just follow it.": null, "Surena: Great, so BINX has been at the tailor's shop for probably about": null, "an hour earlier than they needed to be.": null, "Surena: They have set up the map that Hob had drawn with all of the": null, "scribbles. They have made it 3D, so there's figurines, there's terrain,": null, "there's things. There's\u2014instead of red string, there's like red ribbons": null, "that have been tied to certain parties. The ventriloquist dummies have": null, "new clothes.": null, "Oscar: Yeah!": null, "[Aabria laughs] [Omar claps]": null, "Brennan: Incredible.": null, "Surena:\u00a0And...": null, "Emily: Wait, there's plural now?": null, "Surena: There's so many.": null, "Aabria: You don't just have one ventriloquist dummy.": null, "Lou: This tailor's a freak.": null, "Aabria: That's what I was saying, and y'all made me feel like I was": null, "weird for that.": null, "Oscar: Listen, Geppetto switched careers. That's fine.": null, "Surena: And BINX is nervously waiting for Hob's arrival playing with": null, "that cup and ball, you know? Like sorta just...": null, "Aabria: Yeah. Give me a Dexterity check.": null, "Surena: Just a straight up dex?": null, "Surena: That is 15.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you get the hang of it in probably like 10 minutes.": null, "Surena: So it's just perfect.": null, "Surena: I'm methodically doing it perfect.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, it's like you're that way.": null, "Surena: Like a serial killer.": null, "Aabria: 100%.": null, "Aabria: Cool. [laughs]": null, "Brennan: I open the door to the tailor's shop and stride in and I look": null, "around and go,": null, "Major Hob: Hi.": null, "BINX: Hi.": null, "Major Hob: My word, this is incredible. What a display of...": null, "BINX: Well, I just figured it would be easier, right? Like, just having": null, "them in the physical space. You can move 'em around, and then we can": null, "figure out where we should apply the sneakery and the subterfuge and all": null, "of that.": null, "Major Hob: By Jove, I've finally met another fairy who, honestly works,": null, "who just like, works.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Yeah, I'm just really\u2014": null, "Major Hob: Incredible, it's amazing! You're amazing at this!": null, "BINX:\u00a0I was thinking that about you.": null, "Major Hob: I have so much respect for what you do.": null, "BINX:\u00a0What? Oh my God.": null, "Major Hob: And the Prince Andhera's suit? My Goodness!": null, "BINX: Oh, I don't know. What? Like, we're just like, cool and stuff but\u2014": null, "Major Hob: What are you saying?": null, "BINX: I don't know.": null, "Major Hob: You did make the suit, right?": null, "BINX: I did. Oh my God, I don't know what I was\u2014": null, "Major Hob: Wait, what were you reacting to?": null, "BINX: No, I wasn't reacting to anything!": null, "Major Hob: No, I know!": null, "BINX: I was just\u2014": null, "Major Hob: Hey, listen, I should know about falling in love at the Bloom": null, "last night.": null, "[players laughing] [Aabria screams excitedly]": null, "BINX:\u00a0So, yeah.": null, "Major Hob: What did you say?": null, "BINX: I, uh\u2014": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0You said that.": null, "BINX: Well, I didn't say falling in love.": null, "Major Hob: You said\u2014you did say it!": null, "BINX: I didn't say falling in love! What I'm saying was\u2014": null, "Major Hob: Who'd you fall in love with?": null, "BINX: Andhera.": null, "[Omar and Aabria laugh]": null, "Major Hob: Rue.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Andhera.": null, "Major Hob: And Rue.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Andhera, but\u2014": null, "Major Hob: I\u2019m very much in love. [sobs] I\u2019m very much in love!": null, "BINX: I know, I wasn't saying\u2014I\u2019m trying to like, figure it out, but I": null, "didn\u2019t have anybody to really talk to about it before.": null, "Major Hob: [sobbing] That's so beautiful!": null, "BINX: It's so beautiful. I'm so proud of you!": null, "Major Hob: The black peonies, I was\u2014": null, "BINX:\u00a0The peonies, oh my God\u2014": null, "Major Hob: There was one behind my ear and it was the first time I felt": null, "pretty.": null, "[BINX and Hob sobbing]": null, "BINX: Oh, oh my God. Oh my God.": null, "Major Hob: Oh wait, but you are the leader of the Court of Craft, and I": null, "believe that the young\u2014": null, "[BINX gags]": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0You are, nauseous or not, you are the leader of the Court of": null, "Craft.": null, "BINX: I know, I just, I was just\u2014this is the first leadership position": null, "I've ever really held.": null, "Major Hob: Well. [chuckles]": null, "BINX: And I'm just, you know, and my job before was when everybody": null, "was\u2014when the court was getting ready for their sleepytime hours, I would": null, "bring them blankets and cocoa and we would just sit by the fire and": null, "like, wind down for the evening. But then there were fewer blankets to": null, "bring and then there were none at all, and I was just by myself.": null, "Major Hob: Circumstance makes leaders of many. Most of our company here": null, "at the Bloom, I would say, were born to their position. You and I were": null, "not.": null, "BINX: Right.": null, "Major Hob: And by blood and fang we will prove that we have as much of a": null, "right to be here as any!": null, "BINX: You are absolutely right. We do, we do! [slams table] This figure": null, "right here, this is Sandera, Suntar. Just kidding, Suntar. This is": null, "Suntar!": null, "Major Hob: Suntar, now, I've heard this as well from my Lord and Lady": null, "Blemish, Lord Blemish and Lady Boil that the Unseelie may in fact be in": null, "cahoots with the Court of Wonder.": null, "BINX: So I heard from a kind, hospitable person that that might be true.": null, "Major Hob: Hm, hospitable rings a bell!": null, "Omar:\u00a0Oh.": null, "BINX:\u00a0But\u2014": null, "Emily: Wings a bell.": null, "Brennan: Wings a beak. [cast laughing] Nah, true gibberish.": null, "BINX: I think that Suntar is maybe at the heart of it with Apollo!": null, "Major Hob: [gasps] I'm going to kill him!": null, "BINX: Are you?": null, "Major Hob: Well, that's the plan.": null, "BINX: Well, okay, what if, what if.": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Hm?": null, "BINX: We did a sneaky murder? Like a sneaky sneak murder where it is": null, "Suntar\u2014": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "BINX: Who is framed for Apollo's murder.": null, "[Brennan and Omar gasp]": null, "Major Hob: Now, that is delightfully diabolical, Ms. Choppley.": null, "BINX: I just thought of it. I just thought of it right now.": null, "Major Hob: Yes, to separate the two courts would indeed be most": null, "advantageous. A conversation between you and I think our young friend,": null, "the Prince, maybe will... Listen, I know\u2014": null, "BINX: I just think, you know, why would he? There's like, you know, like": null, "I\u2014there's no reason for him to like me, like, you know what I mean? So": null, "like, it doesn't matter. I mean, sorry. Sorry, I'm projecting. Continue.": null, "Major Hob: Ms. Choppley...": null, "BINX: You can just call me BINX unless you want to call me Ms. Choppley.": null, "It's really up to you, but I don't really need formalities.": null, "Major Hob: BINX.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0BINX.": null, "BINX: BINX.": null, "Major Hob: There are things so precious that even in an immortal life": null, "their coming must be seen as the rarest of all possible gifts.": null, "BINX: [chuckles] I told somebody else that recently.": null, "Major Hob: Many of us see our chance at happiness.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Major Hob: And no matter the length of our reach, know that it is beyond": null, "our grasp. If you have the station that you have, and the Prince sees": null, "something in you, all I can say is this. In love and war you must not": null, "miss your moment to strike. I\u2026 I am headed for a life of service.": null, "BINX: Why?": null, "Surena: And there's no judgment, there's nothing. It's just genuine": null, "curiosity when BINX asks that question.": null, "[tender instrumental music]": null, "Major Hob: Delloso de la Rue is the most singularly courageous,": null, "ethereally beautiful, constant, kind and true Fey I have ever met.": null, "BINX: Mm-hmm.": null, "Major Hob: They have given us all many gifts. Countless Blooms. There": null, "may be no single fairy for whom there is more credit for joy and wonder": null, "than Delloso de la Rue. And last night in an act of graciousness I": null, "cannot begin to comprehend, they showed me kindness and affection, a": null, "gift that I cannot begin to describe the enormity of. But I know that my": null, "affections also caused them great dismay. It was the purpose of the duel": null, "with their assistant, and Rue has enough on their mind. Their bravery in": null, "revealing their true self and their tenuous relationship with the Court": null, "of Wonder and\u2014": null, "BINX: So you've decided for them? Is that what you're doing?": null, "Major Hob: They have decided for them.": null, "Aabria: Cut here really quickly. You said that Rue would have": null, "immediately returned to look for BINX.": null, "Aabria: You go to where you know they are staying in that forgotten": null, "place under the radiator, they are not there. What do you do next?": null, "Oscar: What would I do next? I take a moment and then I think to myself": null, "with a smile on my face, \"I wonder if BINX is with Andhera.\" And I head": null, "over to his quarters.": null, "Aabria: Okay, we cut back to you two.": null, "Brennan: I look at you and I just say,": null, "Major Hob: I have made no decision for them. I would never deign to do": null, "such a thing.": null, "BINX: Well, you're making a bunch of excuses right now for them, right?": null, "No, I'm not trying to say that in a mean way at all. I just want to": null, "understand because I'm very confused. I know what they're doing, but": null, "what are you doing?": null, "Major Hob: I am not going to put them in the position I put them in": null, "before by being forward.": null, "BINX: Well\u2014": null, "Major Hob: They have shown me kindness.": null, "BINX: Yes.": null, "Major Hob: And that is well enough.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Absolutely.": null, "Major Hob: And it was a kindness paid to a humble Goblin by a": null, "beautiful\u2014by a beautiful member of the Court of Wonder, and it was a": null, "deep and profound kindness. And for me to have known even a single day": null, "of love is a gift that I never thought I would be lucky enough to have,": null, "and I will not squander it hoping for more. I will not spoil it hoping": null, "for more. It was beautiful for what it was. And I am ordered to marry.": null, "And I... And I will not...": null, "BINX: Who are you ordered to marry?": null, "Major Hob: A lady of the Seelie Court.": null, "BINX: I am a new court. What if you married into my\u2014not me, Rue.": null, "Major Hob: I... I have already said more than I should.": null, "BINX: And...": null, "Major Hob: BINX, your court is dying. I appreciate the kindness you are": null, "showing me that I might know happiness, but I'm telling you that I": null, "already have. I have known happiness, and what matters now in this": null, "moment, is that we act quickly to save this realm and all others.": null, "Major Hob: Your plan is a brilliant one. You are, frankly, a master": null, "tactician.": null, "BINX: Oh, thank you, I, you know\u2014": null, "Major Hob: But your plan would work best with knowledge of Suntar and": null, "her ways. Prince Andhera is a friend of ours.": null, "Major Hob: I suggest you go to him. If this plan may work, that we may": null, "drive a wedge between the Court of Wonder and the Unseelie, then all may": null, "be saved in time.": null, "BINX: You're right. I guess, you know, thank you for sharing all of this": null, "with me. I know it's, feelings are weird, and it's hard, and\u2014": null, "Major Hob: It's terrible. It's honestly the worst.": null, "BINX: It's terrible and it hurts\u2014": null, "Major Hob: It's the worst, yes.": null, "BINX: When you saying it, and you kinda feel a little nauseous, and I": null, "absolutely understand that. I just, I want you to know that courts,": null, "[scoffs] the royalty, the frivolity, the structure of them, it's all": null, "smoke and mirrors. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter. But I'm": null, "happy for your friendship. I'm happy for you. I do not care of the": null, "Goblin Court, the structures, the orders they give you. That's not what": null, "I care about. I care about you. I want you to be happy, so whatever I": null, "can do to participate in the happiness of you, I'm into it, so.": null, "Major Hob: Though I may never mention it, and will deny it if it is said": null, "in front of my superiors\u2014": null, "BINX: Oh no, I'll help you deny it.": null, "Major Hob: I will say that I treasure your friendship as well.": null, "Aabria: And from there I wanna cut over to Andhera. People are looking": null, "for you. People will be looking for you, but where are you?": null, "Omar: I am down at the mouth of a sea cave. A very tumultuous mouth of a": null, "sea cave.

[blowing wind softens] And for the first time in so long that": null, "she cannot remember, the Queen of Air and Darkness herself is standing": null, "in front of you in the cave. She is darkness personified. Long black": null, "hair, dark skin, dark features, eyes like a shark and teeth feral.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Mm-mm, no.": null, "Aabria: Black and dripping. Black form-fitting robes as she walks": null, "towards you. A being that looks only a little bit like her, and you can": null, "see that in her eyes.": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness: My son.": null, "Andhera: Mm-hmm, hello, Mom.": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness: You called?": null, "Andhera: Yes, and I will be sure to make this as quick as possible. I've": null, "found myself at the center of many spokes of what seems to be a": null, "rapidly-turning wheel.": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness:\u00a0Hm.": null, "Andhera: I have come into the possession of many secrets, many personal": null, "interests.": null, "Surena: Oh, no.": null, "Andhera: And many motivations.": null, "Andhera: I also have the sense that our court is moving towards some": null, "major step, and I've been omitted from that conversation. I would like": null, "that to be swiftly amended considering two features. One, my sister is": null, "making their gamble upon the more chaotic elements of the Bloom.": null, "Andhera: Many have noticed their ambition, and they have been thwarted,": null, "if I'm not incorrect, at every single step of the way. Hardly a shining": null, "example of our court.": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness: Oh.": null, "Andhera: Second, you have not been able to do it yourself, have you? Oh,": null, "you take form now, and I appreciate the gesture. Truly, I do, but if you": null, "were able to do it, you wouldn't have created children to do your": null, "bidding for you. So I elect myself to represent our court. I would like": null, "to know what we are doing. And I would like to actually do it, since": null, "everyone else in my family seems to be flailing and embarrassing us": null, "every step of the way. And if this hurts your tender feelings, Mom, I": null, "would ask you to pack those down. We have work here to do.": null, "Oscar: Pillar Boy, where?": null, "Surena: Damn, damn!": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Pillar Boy, where?": null, "Surena: Pillar Boy, gone.": null, "Oscar: Where?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Where?

I will not speak\u2014": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness: Do you know how many children I have had?": null, "I have watched generation after generation devour themselves to move to": null, "my throne and none are worthy. Why do you think yourself\u00a0different?": null, "Because you learned a fucking secret? Because you sabotaged your sister?": null, "Andhera: Well\u2014": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness: My throne will be held by someone of": null, "steel and shadow both. And you, you cannot help but walk in the light.": null, "You need to be seen, to be loved, to be held.": null, "Andhera: You always said, \"Lies have no form and emit no brilliance.\"": null, "Therefore, you, the Queen of Air and Darkness, have no use for lies. You": null, "see right through them, so I speak plainly to you knowing that you will": null, "tell if I'm lying to you. It is exactly the reasons that you just": null, "shared.": null, "Andhera: I have the boldness to have sentiment. Something that every": null, "single one of your offspring up until now have been considered to be": null, "weakness. Where are they now, dear Queen?": null, "Surena: I mean...": null, "Andhera: And where are their successes? As I have to have this": null, "conversation with you in a fucking sea cave!": null, "[Brennan and Surena laugh]": null, "The Queen of Air and Darkness: I have chosen my domain. And you think": null, "yourself above it.": null, "Andhera: I think myself soon to be the master of it. So let's say this.": null, "I'm included in what we're doing or it doesn't succeed. And that's not a": null, "threat. That's a very ardent prediction. I've studied our history. I": null, "spent most of my childhood in the libraries. It's not an offer. That's": null, "just the two possibilities you're looking at right now.
