(laughs)": null, "Brennan: Does it seem like it- Like, are we gonna walk away and be like": null, "boop-boop and like- Leave our extremely important magical thing?

If possible, I'll halve it and succeed.": null, "A:\u00a0Absolutely. You sort of inspect this and think about what it is and": null, "how it works and you remember that part of the thing that happened that": null, "you felt acutely and maybe you were able to clock in the rest of the": null, "group was that something was taken from you in order to, like, activate": null, "this.": null, "A:\u00a0You felt a little mote, so you could, of course, reactivate it.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Activating this is not done lightly.": null, "A: Yes.": null, "Brennan: We should go by foot.": null, "Erika: Speaking of GPS, I pull out my phone and is there some sort of": null, "service?": null, "A:\u00a0Perfect service.": null, "Lou: Perfect service.": null, "K: Amazing.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Do you have bars?": null, "K: Oh, yeah.

'Cause the rock's going to hear us.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah. Well I'm not sure where the ears on it are.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna pull some bandanas out from my backpack.": null, "Lou: You gonna blindfold it?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I was gonna give this for us to breathe, to be able to breathe": null, "more easily here, but, yeah, I'll tie a little one around Tabby.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I don't trust you.": null, "A: You blindfold a rock.": null, "Jammer: Great call, Evan. Great call.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'm normally pretty cagey, but even this feels like a bridge too": null, "far.": null, "Jammer: You ain't gonna catch us slippin'. I learned from my man.": null, "You ain't gonna catch us slippin'.": null, "(players laughing)": null, "Brennan:\u00a0All right, yeah, let's head out.": null, "A:\u00a0So you don't take Tabby?": null, "D:\u00a0I think we should, but I will defer to the group.": null, "E:\u00a0Oh, I think we should take him but also, yeah, let's keep him in the": null, "handkerchief, just to be extra safe.": null, "B:\u00a0You want to put 'em in the backpack?": null, "E:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "B:\u00a0Okay, and I'll put the second rock in there, too. I'll take both": null, "rocks and throw 'em in the backpack.": null, "A:\u00a0Okay. Give me a Matter roll.": null, "B:\u00a0Okay.": null, "A:\u00a0Difficulty of 10.": null, "B:\u00a0You got it.": null, "A:\u00a0You can dislodge this. It's just a matter of how careful you're": null, "being.": null, "B:\u00a0Can I actually, if it's all right with you, try to do some magic": null, "about this?": null, "A:\u00a0I would love for you to do so. Tell me more.": null, "B:\u00a0I think I'm going to see that they're sort of fixed in the orrery and": null, "I want to take my little Leatherman out and try to follow the seams of": null, "how they were set into this place. And as I'm doing it, I want to make": null, "sure to also sever anything magical in here. So as I cut around the": null, "edges and try to pry them loose, I also want to, like, cut the shadow": null, "off the edge of them so that they can enter my possession from the": null, "device.": null, "A:\u00a0That's something very specific that Evan is quite good at. But I'm": null, "gonna make the DC on this 30. You lean in to start a mechanical pry and": null, "then you go to put a little stank on it and you feel like a very strong-": null, "It's not resistance, but you've cut shadow away before\u2026 All of a sudden": null, "you are engaging with a viscosity.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "A:\u00a0That maybe you've never dealt with before.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Okay, I will abandon the magical half of this and just do the": null, "normal one. I won't do the magic part.": null, "A:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Six. Lucky Break.": null, "A:\u00a0Amazing.": null, "[Players] Ooh.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And a two is eight.": null, "A:\u00a0Eight.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0But I'll go ahead. Oh would we do we reset our tokens at the": null, "beginning of every-": null, "A:\u00a0Your tokens do reset, yeah. Everyone starts with two.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Everyone starts with two. Gotcha, okay. And I'll go ahead and": null, "burn two and get a 10.": null, "A:\u00a0Okay. With exactly a 10, you're able to pry Tabby out of these two": null, "sockets without losing any of the stone.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Okay.": null, "A:\u00a0And you are still aware of that thick shadow around it. Go ahead.": null, "Let's just tag on top of this. Give me a Mind roll and we'll just say": null, "difficulty of 10. We'll match it.": null, "A:\u00a0But this is sort of a snap thing.": null, "Brennan:\u00a011.": null, "A:\u00a0Yeah. So you're able to prise it away and you are deeply aware of the": null, "sense of a shadow connecting Tabby, not just to the sort of amalgam of": null, "things here on your hoopty, but a little bit stuck and sticky on the": null, "orrery itself.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I'll communicate that to the group as I put them in the": null, "backpack.": null, "E:\u00a0What else do we got in the hoopty?": null, "A:\u00a0Yeah. You have four evenly spaced handles, but on the far edge there": null, "is a little, it feels like a glove compartment.": null, "E:\u00a0Ooh. Pop it.": null, "A:\u00a0Pop the glove compartment and inside it\u2026 Everything about your hoopty": null, "feels weirdly very old. It's made of, like, old wood that somehow hasn't": null, "worn away or rotted and old pitted wrought iron, and yet the things in": null, "this glove compartment, it's a used Band-Aid and a blue Bic lighter and": null, "just a bunch of junk. There's nothing in the glove compartment that you": null, "see is useful or special. Just a lot of remnants as though this is a": null, "thing that's passed through many hands.": null, "D:\u00a0So it's like any other glove compartment.": null, "A:\u00a0It's every glove compartment.": null, "D:\u00a0It just has nothing important in it. Okay.": null, "A:\u00a0Nothing important in it.": null, "L:\u00a0Is the registration in there?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It is.": null, "L:\u00a0I don't wanna get pulled over.": null, "A:\u00a0It is, there's a very old piece of paper that the moment you touch": null, "it, like, turns into dust.": null, "You're riding dirty, baby.": null, "L:\u00a0Let's do it.": null, "B:\u00a0All right, let's do it.": null, "A:\u00a0Coming down onto the sand, as you move away from your hoopty, that's": null, "perfectly balanced and, we'll say that for sort of safety's sake, you": null, "land on a rocky outcropping on the coast that sort of obscures a lot of": null, "where your vehicle's sitting. So unless you know exactly what you're": null, "looking for, you're not gonna just see it in the middle of the beach.": null, "And as you get down and walk away and walk around and move more towards": null, "the island and where sound and life and energy are coming from, you see,": null, "like, a snaking little creek of lava. And I need a Mark roll from": null, "everyone. Just DC of 6.": null, "L:\u00a0I exploded.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, let's go.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yay.": null, "L:\u00a0I exploded again.": null, "Aabria: Yeah!": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Exploded.": null, "L:\u00a0I'm done exploding.": null, "(Aabria laughs)": null, "A:\u00a0It got sad at the end.": null, "L:\u00a0I got a 12.": null, "Brennan: 12 as well.": null, "E: I got a three, so that's failure.": null, "D: And I got a two.": null, "A:\u00a0Take that mote of magic, and you both feel a little bit of magical": null, "potential here, but there's like a little flavor to it. It's a little": null, "warm, like warming spices, like cinnamon and cumin. It's a little spicy.": null, "There's something about the flavor of what you're picking up here as you": null, "move through the world.": null, "K: Spices here.": null, "E: I have a little- like, a tiny backpack that has, you know, one of": null, "those cat bubbles and stuff like that for Teddy.": null, "Aabria: Yes.": null, "K:\u00a0Hey, hey, Teddy put on the stillsuit.": null, "Teddy:\u00a0What?": null, "K:\u00a0Put on the stillsuit, you know, come on.": null, "E: He's got a little rack of clothing.": null, "A:\u00a0He just goes in there. He's moved from the rack. He had like a cute": null, "little steamer trunk that he was really excited about so he's just like": null, "pulling things out. There's a little tiny boa and he's like,": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0": null, "Teddy: This doesn't\u2026 Do I have to put the nose part in, too?\"": null, "K:\u00a0Well, unless you want to waste your own body fluids, yeah.": null, ": Am I expected to pee in this?": null, ": It was designed to be used that way, yes.": null, ": So it's functional.": null, ": We didn't really have a conversation. I can't tell when this is": null, "supposed to be like cosplay or, you know.": null, ": Sure. This one's functional.": null, ": Okay.": null, ": You made a tiny suit that can recycle piss into drinking water for": null, "your talking chipmunk?": null, ": Yeah.": null, ": Um\u2026 Hi, when did you have time for that?": null, ": Oh, uh, well you know, my job lets me kind of do other things while": null, "I'm doing it, you know, so.": null, ": Right. Right. Okay.": null, ": You can find patterns just on the dark web.": null, ": Oh you know, that's, I'm happy you're keeping your hands busy. It": null, "sounds like you're having a lot of fun with that and the knitting.": null, ": Yeah, yeah.": null, "A:\u00a0As you two talk and you hear Teddy reciting the \"Litany Against Fear\"": null, "as he puts on his stillsuit.": null, ": (squeaky) \"Fear is the mind killer.\"": null, ": \"Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.\"": null, ": \"Praise the maker.\"": null, "A: Both of our 12s, you see a disruption in the slow, almost": null, "ketchup-like flow of the lava as something underneath the surface of it": null, "begins to disturb it. And both of you spot, as there's a little bulge in": null, "the creek, as something sort of warps out as a little creature emerges.": null, "J:\u00a0Ay, yo, yo. Yo, yo, you see that?": null, ": Whoa.": null, "Evan:\u00a0So there are some extremophiles in the natural world that can": null, "survive very high heat. To my knowledge there is no natural organism": null, "that can survive a lava flow.": null, ": Well I mean in the human, mundane world, but-": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh yes, that's what I'm saying. A magical creature's about to pop": null, "out.": null, ": Oh, okay.": null, ": Oh.": null, "A:\u00a0Sorry, that's is very funny. You both turn and see a salamander sort": null, "of break through the surface. And far away, it's cute and small, and the": null, "scale of this place is still a little bent and warped because you don't": null, "have human-made structures or other people to get a sense of scale. But": null, "as it gets a little closer, you see it's about eight feet long, three": null, "feet tall at the shoulders and as the sort of magma and lava clears off": null, "of it, it looks almost like modeled tortoise shell, but within it live": null, "magma, like a water balloon.": null, "(players exclaiming)": null, "And one breaks through the surface and starts sniffing around.": null, ": We started out and it's like, \"oh how cute. Oh. Oh-ho?\"": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And when you say salamanders, you mean it looks like the": null, "amphibian not a mythological salamander-": null, "A:\u00a0Yes, correct.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It looks like a- Gotcha.": null, "A:\u00a0Yes.": null, "J:\u00a0Hey yo, my man. My man.": null, "A:\u00a0You yell?": null, "L:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "A:\u00a0You yell and this thing that was like sniffing the air locks in on": null, "you": null, "(dramatic battle music)": null, "and begins to scuttle forward. And as it breaks all the way through the": null, "surface, it's followed by another one.": null, "L:\u00a0Oh.": null, "E:\u00a0Oh.": null, "D:\u00a0Oh.": null, "A:\u00a0And a third.": null, "J:\u00a0Hey we're here, we're looking for Boudicca? For Boudicca. Delivery": null, "for Boudicca.": null, "A: This thing that looks almost a perfect bubble-shaped like an": null, "amphibian opens its mouth and its teeth, there are several rows of sharp": null, "teeth that look like cooled obsidian sitting inside of hot magma as it": null, "opens its mouth and you can see its neck vibrate as it makes this like\u2026": null, "(Aabria croaks)": null, "L:\u00a0Oh, shit, we about to do violence?": null, "A:\u00a0And it lunges at you.": null, "L:\u00a0All right, let's do violence.": null, "B:\u00a0Great.": null, "A:\u00a0Great.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Evan goes,": null, "Evan: All right, batter up.": null, "L:\u00a0I'm gonna jump out of the way to start.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, go ahead and give me a Matter roll. The difficulty's gonna": null, "be 12.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: It's like you were watching it, so it's not, there's no sense of": null, "surprise here.": null, "A:\u00a0But when it speeds up and makes a decision to attack, it gets much": null, "faster than expected.": null, "L:\u00a0Great. That's 17.": null, "L: I'm gonna hop out of the way and, hm. I guess Jammer was not ready to": null, "attack, but that's what's up.": null, "A:\u00a0That is in fact what's up.": null, "L:\u00a0I think in thinking about mobility and his own movement, I think he's": null, "going to pull out his wand and attempt to make the floor beneath these": null, "creatures ice or cooled. That's what is in his mind at this time.": null, "A:\u00a0Now going back to the difficulties of magic that you've experienced": null, "in the world, we are only a couple days and a couple plane flights away": null, "from a struggle to push three toys a foot and a half.": null, "L:\u00a0Mm-hm.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And now you want to turn an amount of ground underneath this": null, "first salamander into ice?": null, "L:\u00a0That's correct.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay.\u00a0How big of an area are you shooting for?": null, "L:\u00a0I think just the first salamander. I think, yeah, I think it's, I": null, "think I'm aware of the other dangers behind it, but I think I'm": null, "concerned with the one that is most pressing.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, give me a Maneuver roll.": null, "Aabria: This is pretty impressive magic. And magic is not impossible but": null, "it is difficult.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0DC's 25.": null, "L:\u00a025. Great. You just gotta explode multiple times.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Remember, don't forget": null, "to use your Magic die.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh, I will.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay.": null, "L:\u00a0Okay, that's a one on the Maneuver.": null, "(Aabria coughs)": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "L:\u00a0So I've just got to explode like four times straight.": null, "Aabria: What could happen?": null, "L: Did not. That is a three total.": null, "L:\u00a0Three total.": null, "(Erika gasps)": null, "L: So that's a massive failure. A truly massive failure.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Don't forget to take an adversity token for the failure and one": null, "for attempting magic.": null, "L:\u00a0Great.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You go and try to push magic out to change temperature, \u00a0to": null, "change, like, the form, add water in a place that seems very dry. All of": null, "a sudden your mind is deeply aware of all of the complex things that": null, "have to happen in order for ice to appear under the salamander. And you": null, "just feel that stickiness. It's not quite there. It's a little bit": null, "bigger than the thing you're trying to do. I'm gonna ask you one extra": null, "question. In your intention behind doing this magic, was it \"it must be": null, "ice so I can cool it and it stops moving or it slips\"?": null, "L:\u00a0Stop it, I think. Yeah, I don't think Jammer's intention was to": null, "immediately escalate. I think it's like \"can we give ourselves space to": null, "regroup by impeding this thing?\"": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So the magic doesn't work but you feel something alight on this": null, "creature and almost as though it, like, bumped on something. It like": null, "staggers a step as it lunges past you and you see it sort of change its": null, "form, like where head kind of pulls into its body and the new head sort": null, "of changes and moves out of its shoulder. It's like a blob re-forming": null, "itself in the direction it wants to be in rather than something": null, "physically turning.": null, ":\u00a0Oh.": null, ":\u00a0Oh!": null, "D: Absolutely not.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0But there is that sense of, like, there's a stutter there.": null, "L:\u00a0Mm.": null, "Aabria: And I think even without rolling you have that sense of you knew": null, "what you wanted to do and then something a little weird happened there.": null, "Lou: Mm.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The other two are in close pursuit and they, where do you think": null, "everyone is? Like let's get a little mental model of where everyone is": null, "sort of in relation to one another as I attempt to kill you with my": null, "little guys.": null, "(Aabria claps)": null, "E:\u00a0I would probably be hanging back with Sam.": null, "D:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "E: And I had been sort of talking into my backpack.": null, "B:\u00a0I think Evan is standing right next to Jammer, a little bit in front": null, "of K and Sam, and I think was having a moment where he was, like, \"Dude": null, "you've had a freaky couple years. You just got off the hoopty. Don't": null, "freak your old friends out by being immediately violent. Perhaps these": null, "lava lizards are buddies. Don't jump immediately to a conclusion.

Oh!": null, "(Brennan yells)": null, "B: I'm going to see that big magic, that basically we have not gone": null, "through the Bermuda Triangle into like Wonkaland, magic is everywhere": null, "and easy. We're still a little bit fucked. Evan is going to think of the": null, "smallest kind of cantrip he can do to just gas the magic already in his": null, "shoes that makes them resistant to environmental effects, and he's going": null, "to kick one of the salamanders to death as fast as he can.": null, ": Oh! Wow! Yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So the magic is for your personal endurance for the extreme": null, "environment that is this thing?": null, "B:\u00a0It's like, don't have my foot burn as I kick lava.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, perfect. The other two salamanders that were following": null, "behind the main one circle on you as you attempt magic to sort of": null, "bolster yourself. Let's call it a Mettle roll.": null, "B:\u00a0Cool.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Let's drop the DC to 15.": null, "B:\u00a0Okay, and am I rolling with Magic die there?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yep.": null, "(Lou laughs)": null, ":\u00a0Let's go.": null, ": And that moves to a d6 for this continuing roll.": null, ": Yep.": null, ": Right?": null, ": It moves on the ladder. It will stay there.": null, ":\u00a0It will stay there. Amazing. So four and seven is 11. I need a four,": null, "so I have a 50/50 chance of making this work. Five!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Amazing! Evan, let's talk about your shoes real quick. What's": null, "your ritual when you sort of take care of them? This is, like, these are": null, "your nice, these are your good shoes.": null, "B:\u00a0These shoes are Evan's whole emotional life at this moment in time.": null, "One of the- one of countless traumatic memories he has from a dangerous": null, "demon-filled childhood that is traumatic because it was a social": null, "interaction that went poorly was a time that- It was the first time in a": null, "long time that he had gotten clean pants and shirt and underwear and": null, "socks and actually felt like he looked like a normal teenager for the": null, "first time when he was about like 14 years old. And he walked into a": null, "sort of soup kitchen in Iowa that was, you know, and felt like \"oh I": null, "might walk in and it not be clear whether I'm here to be fed or here to": null, "volunteer.\" And someone immediately clocked him and he kind of felt": null, "defeated by it and they were like, \"Your shoes are destroyed.\" Like you": null, "can always tell that someone's poor by their shoes. And so that's": null, "something he's always carried with him, which is that it's easier to get": null, "clean socks, it's easier to get a clean shirt. Getting new shoes is": null, "really hard and getting shoes that are nice is really hard. So the fact": null, "that in that year he was working at Gowpenny after graduation before it": null, "disappeared, the number one thing he thought of was, I need to get a": null, "nice pair of shoes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Your very nice shoes that are lovingly maintained and scrubbed": null, "and buffed and shined, you almost smell a little bit of your shoe polish": null, "and leather conditioner in your nose so high up as the magic extends,": null, "and you go to kick the second salamander and you don't feel, like you": null, "are aware of the heat of this, 'cause you can, like, you know it but you": null, "don't feel it as you are buffeted by impossible hot and begin to": null, "absolutely knock the crap out of this. Your foot sinks in, it like": null, "deforms the shape of the salamander. You feel something under your foot,": null, "again with that water balloon analogy. Like sometimes when you underfill": null, "a water balloon and you're like, \"oh if I just, just a little harder or": null, "find a little edge to pop it.\" That's what you're aware of as this": null, "thing, you kick it a bunch and it like flattens out and tries to shrink": null, "back on itself in a little blob as the third one rocks up and is going": null, "to try to sidestep you and is going to aim for\u2026 K.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I whip out my wand and I try to think very, very hard about how I": null, "have protected my Airstream and I throw out an asbestos blanket.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You want to summon an asbestos blanket?": null, "E:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Very specific.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay. DC 30.": null, ": Confidently.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Just a Melee roll.": null, "E:\u00a0All right. That's a three for Melee. Then it's a one on the Magic": null, "die. So that's a total of four.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You have fought many times in the defense of your home, your": null, "trailer, both magically and otherwise. And you feel something, you are": null, "very aware of something here inside the storm. Magic isn't easier here": null, "but you are a little more aware of what it is around you. It's so": null, "specific. It's pointed. It's creating exactly one thing of a specific": null, "shape and aiming it exactly on a moving target. You're suddenly aware of": null, "the math of the magic you're trying to do as your wand sort of fails you": null, "in that moment and it's going to lunge forward and it gets really close": null, "to the center of your chest and before it bites down, you feel this": null, "(sharp inhale) as suction hits and it pulls you the rest of the way into": null, "his jaws and it's going to bite down. Please take a minor damage.": null, ":\u00a0Shit.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you now just sort of have a big old guy on your chest.": null, ": Ah!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sam, what would you like to do?": null, "D:\u00a0Okay, well so now I gotta focus on the big old guy on K's chest.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0There's several of them. You can focus on whatever you want.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0No, I'm gonna go ahead and stop my friend from getting their": null, "head bitten off. So I'm gonna turn to the guy. I'm watching as magic is": null, "like not working for anybody except, you know, obviously Evan can kick.": null, "And so... (laughs)": null, ": Evan can kick.": null, ":\u00a0Evan can kick.": null, ":\u00a0Evan's over here. Dream small!": null, ":\u00a0Small?": null, ": Small!": null, ": Small.": null, "D:\u00a0Okay, so I'm just gonna turn to the, thinking if the creature is": null, "talking, then they can't use their mouth.": null, "S: Hi.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Which one are you talking to?": null, "D:\u00a0I'm talking to the one with K.": null, "E:\u00a0The one on top of me.": null, "D:\u00a0The one on top of K.": null, "D:\u00a0So just Sam goes to tap on the shoulder and then was like, oh wait, I": null, "can't do that because like\u2026": null, "S: Hi. Hey, hi. What's your name?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0In this moment, I'm not going to progress what will naturally": null, "happen. I just wanna give you sort of, in bullet time, the interaction": null, "that's happening here. There's no roll required because these things are": null, "animals or constructs or something that doesn't have a sense of engaging": null, "with you beyond a target being acquired. Like you kind of feel and see": null, "K's whole body jerk as this thing hears you and is trying to sort of": null, "move. But very specifically, there's no eyes that you can see that lock": null, "onto you.": null, ":\u00a0Are the ears visible? Bull salamander-y ears?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's not really a sense of a visible ear. Again, think of a": null, "balloon in the shape of a thing, but you have a sense of the bulge in": null, "its very triangular head that was turning to hear you. So you have a": null, "sense of where an ear would be would be about back here on its head.": null, "D:\u00a0Gotcha. So Sam reaches into her pockets, pulls out, I know Sam's": null, "gonna have something in there. Sam pulls out like a set of keys, her": null, "house keys. Sam pulls out her house keys.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's just great that they're in your pocket. Like that was gonna": null, "come up on a magical trip. I love it.": null, "D:\u00a0Mom says bring your keys.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I love it.": null, "D:\u00a0So Sam takes her keys out and starts, like, jingling them.": null, "Sam: Hello? Ch-ch-ch-ch.": null, "D: Like trying to get the creature's attention, so maybe when the": null, "creature is distracted, it'll like un-glomp off of K. So she's just like": null, "jingling keys but jingling keys magically? I don't know.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Are you trying to jingle them magically or are you jingling": null, "keys? We're gonna be so specific now-": null, ": \u00a0Yeah.": null, ":\u00a0Because I'm about to-": null, ":\u00a0For the love of God, jingle them magically.": null, ": Yeah, they have to be jingled magically. They are magically jingling.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay then go ahead and give me, this does feel like a Magnetism": null, "roll.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0To...": null, "D:\u00a0I did it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What is your, like, I know we were talking about it above the": null, "table about, like, what the shape of it is. But for Sam in this moment,": null, "what is her intention as she reaches towards magic and jingles her car": null, "keys?": null, "D:\u00a0What Sam is trying to do is trick this creature into believing": null, "there's something more interesting or possibly delicious. Sam don't know": null, "if like it\u2026 Reading context clues, Sam is assuming this thing angry. So": null, "she is, the way that you would maybe, like a pet or something, she's": null, "trying to signal that there's treats over here, so let go of my friend.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So the intention is attention.": null, "D:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, give me a Magnetism roll. The difficulty's going to be 15.": null, "D:\u00a0Okay, and then I'm also gonna do that with my Magic die, right?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, use your Magic die.": null, "D:\u00a0All right, so difficulty": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Here we go, here we go.": null, ":\u00a0Why?": null, "L:\u00a0Brennan, don't look like that, man.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What happened?": null, "B:\u00a0Me looking like that is not the cause of what I just saw.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What did you do?": null, "B:\u00a0I...": null, ": He did a full like...": null, "B: I'll put it this way. We rolled the die and (stuttering) what was on": null, "the first die made the second die kind of not matter.": null, ":\u00a0But maybe I- look.": null, "So the first die I rolled a four.": null, "D:\u00a0On my d20.": null, ": Oh, no.": null, "D: So now I'm going to-": null, ": Let us explode.": null, "D:\u00a0Roll my magic. Let us explode!": null, ":\u00a0Let us explode.": null, ": Explode four times.": null, ": You've got it.": null, "D: And that...": null, ": (whispered) Brennan.": null, "D: Is a crit one. We did it.": null, ": Well-": null, ": By doing nothing. Nothing.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Go ahead and take two motes of magic.": null, "D:\u00a0Thank you for my motes. Sorry about your head.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And the thing I will offer along with that mote of magical": null, "potential, your intention was get its attention, try to draw it away,": null, "and you feel the bump that this thing isn't hungry. This thing wants to": null, "attack. And that's kind of all you get for why the magic failed. But you": null, "still jingle your keys and that means there is now sort of one and a": null, "half other salamanders that are going to move towards you.": null, "Sam:\u00a0They're not hungry, guys. They just want to attack.": null, ":\u00a0Okay.": null, ": All right, it's a territorial thing.": null, ": Yeah, yeah, they're not, they didn't just come up 'cause we sounded": null, "good.": null, "Evan:\u00a0They might eat rocks. I don't even know if they eat organic": null, "material. There's not a lot of life here for that. Sorry. Fuckin' die!": null, "(Brennan grunts)": null, ": Evan's truly got his foot in the ass of one of these.": null, ":\u00a0They're like balloons. You gotta pop 'em!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You say that. Jammer, the one that lunged past you is now trying": null, "to move in Sam's direction. What do you want to do?": null, "L:\u00a0Jammer hears Evan say, \"Dream smaller.\"": null, "And as I think, like, wand extended, looks at his, is taking stock of": null, "his own body and sees the sweat on his hand and goes,": null, "J: Ice too big. Water. That's a step down, I think.": null, "(Erika laughing)": null, "L: So I'm gonna try, I'm thinking, like, I think Jammer's picturing like": null, "a Super Soaker, like that amount of water projecting from his wand and": null, "hoping that that feels, in his head, he is convinced that it's smaller.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Make water out the wand. Super-Soak it. DC 12. Melee roll.": null, "L:\u00a0Melee roll. Okay.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Ooh.": null, ": Melee, DC 12. And we're doing magic about it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you're doing magic about it.": null, "L:\u00a0Guys, I feel good about this.": null, ":\u00a0I feel really good about it.": null, ": I feel good about this. I feel positive. They both explode.": null, "(players cheering)": null, ": Here we go.": null, ": So we're at 16.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Amazing.": null, ":\u00a0This goes up to a d8.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Beautiful.": null, ": Do I roll a d8 on the explosion?": null, "Aabria: Yes, yeah.": null, ": Okay. Wow, so we're at 16. Plus one for 22.": null, "Aabria:\u00a022 over 12.": null, "Lou: 22 over 12.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's simple. Water, a direction.": null, "L: Yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Intention to do what?": null, "L:\u00a0I think I'm watching Evan kick the shit out of this thing and I'm": null, "just, I think I want to cool it off. This whole situation needs to calm": null, "down. It's hot, I'm stressed, and I think I'm picturing a hot summer's": null, "day, fire hydrant getting cracked open, like that kind of, that ease,": null, "that calmness. Bringing the temperature down quite literally.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You stack all of those things, a mental image, a strong clear": null, "desire, and simple magic. And yeah, with a critical success, water": null, "shoots out of your wand. It's not a Super Soaker, it is a fire hose.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it alights and you see it sort of begin to cause, all of": null, "that magma under your salamander's surface, begins to harden and it": null, "slows down. And you even feel the temperature around you right now just": null, "takes a little edge off the heat and it gets a little more humid in": null, "here. And the one that was aiming for Sam that was leaving you, 10": null, "above, freezes in place, jaw open, just stuck there.": null, "(Lou breathing heavily)": null, "J:\u00a0Water! Water!": null, ": Woo!": null, ":\u00a0Good job.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Who wants to go next?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Okay, I...": null, ": I like the raise of your hand, like...": null, "Erika: I\u00a0am on my back with the salamander on top of me and my broom is": null, "underneath me and I think about it and I'm like, okay, let's go. Okay,": null, "come on. And I want to activate my broom.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah. So here's the thing, your broom is a magical object under": null, "your control, so there's nothing to roll to activate it. It's going to": null, "do it. Now, any roll that we're going to do is going to be a Maneuver": null, "roll to see how successful and agile you are in whatever you want to do.": null, "But the moment you think about your broom, you feel it sort of, it's not": null, "a vibration, but something moves into alignment behind you, and you are": null, "aware that it is on and ready. Like Bluetooth paired with the magic": null, "inside you.": null, ":\u00a0Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ah, good, good, good. Okay. Up, up and out.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0All right give me a, let's go DC 8 Maneuver roll.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it's going to rocket you and this salamander into the air.": null, "Erika:\u00a0And I'm gonna do magic about it as well and try to give it a": null, "little extra oomph to kick off.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So the magic there is to increase velocity?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0With the hope of disentangling the thing that's biting onto you?": null, "E: Or at least get it up. Get us both up or just give it a little extra": null, "kick.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0If you're doing magic about it, I'm changing the DC.": null, "E:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So I'm gonna throw another six on top of it.": null, "E:\u00a0Yeah. You know what? Can Teddy help?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0If you can tell me how Teddy helps you, I will lower the DC.": null, "(Erika laughs)": null, "E:\u00a0I want Teddy to, um\u2026 I want him to pull the little ripcord on the": null, "backpack to sort of detach it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So the Muad'Dib activates behind you, ripcord's your backpack.": null, "So let's drop this DC. Your DC's now 12.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Try to engage in something screwy here.": null, "E:\u00a0Okay, magic explodes.": null, "E:\u00a0Four, and then plus four. I'm gonna burn two to explode the Magic": null, "die.": null, ": Smart.": null, ": Wee.": null, ": Let's go.": null, ": All right, all right.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, yes, yes.": null, "E: A 12, and then, so that makes up to eight. Seven. So I'm gonna, and": null, "I'm gonna move that up to 10.": null, "Danielle: Yo.": null, ":\u00a0Amazing. Let's go.": null, ": Let's see here.": null, "Aabria:\u00a023 over 12.": null, "Aabria: Incredible. Teddy ripcord's your backpack. He's holding onto you": null, "and onto the broom so your hands are free as you're still trying to push": null, "this thing off of you. And the broom begins to spin and you're now": null, "getting like an in-air alligator roll-": null, ": Yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0To get this thing off of you.": null, ": Yo.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0There's no extra damage to this, but just for flavor, when a": null, "thing is very clamped on you and suddenly gets thrown off, it will take": null, "a chunk of your clothing and some just abrasions across your very good": null, "abs.": null, ":\u00a0Oh, my tits.": null, "(Erika groans)": null, "Aabria: As this thing like gets rolled, thrown off, hits the ground, and": null, "the balloon pops. I need all three of you to make a Maneuver roll.": null, "Difficulty of just 6 as this thing hits, pops, and explodes.": null, ": 10.": null, "Aabria: Perfect.": null, ": Five.": null, ": Explosion.": null, ": Amazing.": null, ": 20...": null, ": Oh my god.": null, ": Four? 24.": null, ": Oh, sure.": null, ": Ooh.": null, "L: Can I save Evan?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0With a 24? Absolutely. You watch as, all of a sudden, K rockets": null, "up into the sky and you see that last little bit. It's like being a": null, "little kid and watching a group playing crack the whip and you're like,": null, "oh I can see it.": null, "Aabria: One more big snake and that thing's gonna go flying. And you": null, "call the timing right. You're able to move away, cover Evan, and get him": null, "out of Dodge as this thing hits and pops and explodes, and you see like": null, "pockmarks of heat and singeing and smoke come off from where these": null, "things, like when they pop, it's painful. You, in the sky, you feel that": null, "magic stack. It was a very simple thing to do. Go a little faster, push": null, "a little harder, do a little more. But all of a sudden it feels like": null, "momentum building inside you. That sense of like spice and heat. Like": null, "you feel as warm as the world around you and magic feels closer, and": null, "you're very aware of the magic that feels good here. It is making": null, "something. Where there was not something, you could make something new,": null, "and you feel deeply in alignment on that. Who wants to go next?": null, ": Oh, should I take a-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You take a token for attempting magic.": null, ":\u00a0Oh do we all?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh yeah, sorry about that. Every time you attempt magic, you": null, "take a mote of magic.": null, "B:\u00a0I'm gonna look up and say, Thanks, big man. And I'm going to, the one": null, "I've half kicked to death, I would like to kick the other half to death.": null, "Gotta finish what you start.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Perfect. So the first one, the roll that involved the magic, we": null, "used a different stat because it's about creating that magical barrier": null, "for you, but now that that's up, this is just a Melee roll. Go ahead. To": null, "just kick it all the way to death, DC 15.": null, "B:\u00a0Great. Uh, buh, buh. That is going to be, you know what? I don't do": null, "it.": null, "(Aabria gasps)": null, "I don't do it. I rolled a three on the die plus eight is 11.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What is Evan's intention right now? Is it destruction at any": null, "cost? Like, I wanna talk about the way in which a thing Evan is": null, "incredibly good at doesn't quite hit and I wanna give you something": null, "else. So if you can tell me a way in which Evan might have pulled a": null, "punch.": null, "B:\u00a0I think it feels so good to kick this thing that he doesn't actually": null, "want it to go away.": null, "B:\u00a0And I think there's a, I think his eyes go dark and it's a moment of": null, "not having to be in his mind and that it's just the joy of kicking this": null, "lizard. This uncomplicatedly aggressive, hostile, not even a natural": null, "animal, just a lava magic that hurts strangers who show up here, and if": null, "he could kick this thing for the rest of his life, he would.": null, "(Aabria exhales)": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Give me\u2026 Give me a Mind roll. Difficulty of 5.": null, "B:\u00a0Snap?": null, "Aabria: Yeah.": null, "B: He gets a five.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0With exactly a five\u2026 You know exactly the amount of pressure it": null, "takes to pop this balloon and yet there is a simple joy inside this and": null, "there's something that syncs up in your mind while you do this that lets": null, "you know that the creature you're kicking is doing what it was meant to": null, "do, which is be a thing to be kicked. And there is that really clear": null, "understanding that these monsters exist to be monsters to resist or": null, "fight.": null, "B:\u00a0I think everyone just watches Evan, kind of like- it's so clear that": null, "it needs, it needs one good one, but that would require backing up and": null, "Evan doesn't want to back up right now so he's too in its space, kicking": null, "this thing, and it's not a threat anymore. It's like he's keeping it off": null, "balance and just going nuts and going\u2026 In the moment, I think when he": null, "realizes that these things are just here to hurt people, he's like in": null, "his head like, I know that song, and just keeps kicking.": null, "D:\u00a0Yeah, I'm gonna take my turn now.": null, "So Sam definitely sees that Evan's having a moment. Which is like, oh,": null, "this feels like this is getting unnecessarily dark.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "D:\u00a0And so Sam just kind of sees that it's got, like Evan's not gonna let": null, "go, he's not gonna back up. She has seen that Jammer was able to produce": null, "water. So Sam is just like, I gotta water this thing. So Sam's gonna": null, "take her wand out and just think like, water, water, water, water. Like": null, "Sam will spit on it at this point if she has to because this is freaking": null, "her out.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Create water with your wand. A simple desire. You're in": null, "proximity. Give me a Melee roll, and you're using magic, difficulty of": null, "12.": null, "D:\u00a0Okay, well so that's a four plus one. So that's five, and then let's": null, "magic about it. And that's a one. What is happening in my hands today?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's okay. Gimme a-": null, "B:\u00a0You have enough tokens to blow up that-": null, "D:\u00a0Yeah I'm gonna.": null, "B: If you want.": null, "D:\u00a0Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead-": null, ": Let's ride.": null, ":\u00a0Yeah.": null, ": Let's go!": null, ": Let it ride!": null, ": Yay!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Let's go!": null, ":\u00a0And then, now do I get to go up again?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Now you're gonna roll a d8.": null, "D:\u00a0Let's go. And that's a one, but that's okay.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You know that it is, Evan's popping off in a very weird way and": null, "you want to help, but what's your intention in the water on the": null, "creature?": null, "D:\u00a0After having watched that work with Jammer and his wand, the": null, "intention is just like stop the creature. Do the explode-y thing and": null, "make 'em explode and have those little bits of ash all over.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you hit it with that water and just like you saw with": null, "Jammer's salamander, you see it go, like, it cools and goes inert under": null, "its skin and does not explode, subjecting all of you to the danger of": null, "its hot splash as it goes, and everything stops and it all cools down a": null, "little bit. K, you're still up in the sky. Three of you are on the": null, "ground and I need Jammer, because you're in proximity, can you give me a": null, "Mark roll, difficulty of four.": null, "J:\u00a0You got it. Exactly four.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Ay!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0As everything calms down, you glance down and Evan has his": null, "shadow.": null, "J:\u00a0Hey yo.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Shit!": null, "B: Um (laughs) what happens when I look at my shadow?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You look at your shadow and it reacts exactly like a shadow": null, "would. It moves in the way you do. Nothing is off.": null, "J:\u00a0Isn't that your? Didn't? It was like a\u2026": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "J:\u00a0You guys were like a whole thing.": null, "J:\u00a0And you didn't have it in Sumba.": null, "- No.": null, "No.": null, "Can I do a magic check to": null, "like investigate it or?": null, "- Yeah, go ahead and give me a Mind roll.": null, "We'll call the difficulty": null, "- Can Jammer touch it with his toe": null, "to see if it does anything?": null, "- Yeah.": null, "- Hey.": null, "- And I am gonna do a spell here.": null, "- I'm gonna like reach out": null, "and try to, like-": null, "- 1000%.": null, "(dice thuds)": null, "- That's gonna be 22.": null, "- Oh, shit.": null, "I don't know why I thought you were gonna get very close to the number": null, "10 and not": null, "a scrillion more. (laughs)": null, "You look down at your shadow and I think because of the 22, the scuffed": null, "toe gives you just a little bit of physical feedback.": null, "Like the shadow doesn't move but you know that you kicked something.": null, "Does that make sense?": null, "- I kicked something?": null, "Like I touched the edge of his shadow and I made contact with something?": null, "- Yes.": null, "- I take like four steps back.": null, "Oh, sh-": null, "- You look down at your shadow.": null, "What do you want to know?": null, "Because all of a sudden you feel like a circuit is completed and": null, "whatever your shadow is is very locked into you right now.": null, "- Can I ask, in terms of my historical context with my shadow, it's": null, "always been, like in my childhood it was like,": null, "\"Oh no my shadow's here. It's chasing me, ahh.\"": null, "Not- In a very different tone.": null, "Thanks for making it sound nice.": null, "Ahh! Right?": null, "So, I don't think I've ever seen it just actually mirror my movements": null, "before, so I think-": null, "- Maybe if you have, just to jump in, if it ever did it, it was briefly": null, "and mocking you.": null, "Like it was doing a perfect, like we're doing the same thing at the same": null, "time,": null, "but you knew it wasn't your shadow.": null, "It was your capital S shadow": null, "doing what you're doing.": null, "- I guess what I'm saying": null, "is do I get the impression": null, "that that curse or being is gone": null, "and I just have a normal shadow again": null, "or is my capital S": null, "shadow here and behaving?": null, "- Your capital S shadow": null, "is here and behaving.": null, "- I'm gonna go and I'm": null, "gonna walk up towards": null, "a more vertical stone so that,": null, "like if my shadow's on a horizontal plane,": null, "it stretches far away,": null, "I'm gonna interpose from": null, "the light of the lava": null, "to get my shadow up": null, "against a vertical surface.": null, "And I'm gonna walk up and go,": null, "I think we might be okay.": null, "And I'm gonna turn to look at my shadow": null, "and grab its throat and": null, "go, You do what I do now.": null, "Not what you do.": null, "- You are physically": null, "holding onto something,": null, "your shadow, that was, again,": null, "a perfect mimic of what a": null, "shadow is supposed to be,": null, "up until the moment you grabbed it,": null, "then reacts and it just points away.": null, "But you don't have any": null, "sense of resistance.": null, "This thing was grabbed": null, "and you get all of the": null, "feeling of like a dog": null, "showing you its stomach.": null, "- I look down at Sam.": null, "- I'm gonna turn.": null, "Hey, gang.": null, "- Shadow knows.": null, "So, Shadow back, seemingly obeying.": null, "It pointed this way.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And the moment you turn and point, you all see figures off in": null, "the distance, sort of moving through the haze and orange glow. Three": null, "sort of walking, one sitting, moving across the ground, not with": null, "anything wheeled. You see almost like sled tracks. Three strangers. One": null, "familiar. As Tallulah Jillymont makes eye contact with all of you and": null, "goes,": null, "Tallulah: No fucking way.": null, "B:\u00a0I look to my companions with the look of, like, this is a person who": null, "was, the last time we interacted with her, actively trying to kill all": null, "of us and someone needs to know something I don't know because I'm in": null, "the wrong head space to not immediately go to killing her and these": null, "people.": null, "L:\u00a0I'm just gonna put my hand on my chest, look at you.": null, "K:\u00a0Tallulah?": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0K. Sam.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Hey, Tallooz.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0Never liked that nickname, thank you so much.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Hey, Taytay.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0Oh it got worse. Fun. Evan, Jammer.": null, "Aabria: And as she sort of turns her head, you see the three years have": null, "aged her more than I think most. Like she looks a little bit older than": null, "the rest of you, like the lines in her face are a little harder. Sort of": null, "dishwater blonde hair is, like, shaved on one side. There's like a": null, "tattoo of a bird of prey rampant, sort of wings out flying up out of a": null, "fire or something. It's in red and gold. And her whole body, she was": null, "already like very slight as a teen. Like, you can see the wiriness of": null, "her under her sort of loose clothing.

I didn't make those.": null, "This place did. Are you okay? Did you deal with them?": null, "Aabria: And she sees, and you like hear a little bit of chatter from the": null, "other three as they're talking and they see the two that are frozen and": null, "sort of the scattered pockmarks of burn, like, \"Seems well handled.\"": null, ":\u00a0Yeah, clearly we could handle ourselves.": null, ":\u00a0I got the hose.": null, "Tallulah: Hose. Oh you used water. Make sense.": null, "Evan:\u00a0You're injured.": null, "K:\u00a0Yeah, no, no, I'm just a little. It's fine.": null, "Evan: You sure?": null, ":\u00a0Are we going to have a problem?": null, ": No, we're just here to give some shit to Boudicca and then we're on": null, "our way.": null, "Tallulah: Philtrum?

I'm K.": null, "Aabria: The taller of the two dudes steps forward. He's like,": null, "Victor: I'm Victor.": null, "Aabria: You guys are all sort of early 20s, but this looks like someone": null, "just a little bit older than you. Taller Black dude with dreads pulled": null, "back into a ponytail and has, like, all of him is bulky and wide like a": null, "swimmer, but sort of like a rolled shoulder forward that reminds you of": null, "a boxer.": null, ": Why is everyone here hot?": null, ": I think it's just like the survival survivor, gritty survivor thing.": null, ": Like urgh, it's so dangerous here. It's turned me into like a wild": null, "person but like, ooh, on the inside maybe I'm sweet.": null, "B: I'm gonna look at Victor and say,": null, "Evan: Is Boudicca Philtrum not present on Galamanis?": null, "Victor: Um, Philtrum? God I haven't thought about her in a really long": null, "time. No. What did you say this place was?": null, "Evan:\u00a0Galamanis?": null, "Victor:\u00a0Galamanis?": null, ": Yeah, Rock told us it's called Galamanis.": null, ": Oh. Okay. Cool.": null, ": What do you call this place?": null, ": Oh, this is just home.": null, ": You live here?": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah, I live in a home too but I know I live in a city called": null, "Glasgow.": null, ": Well the world kind of broke and then these islands popped up and this": null, "is the one that we chose.": null, "J:\u00a0So y'all didn't even name it just for, like, fun?": null, ": No, you name everything everywhere you go?": null, "Evan:\u00a0This guy literally names everything.": null, "J:\u00a0I name quite literally, I give nicknames to people immediately. I": null, "looked at you and I thought about a nickname.": null, ": Wait, hold on. What's my nickname?": null, ":\u00a0Marley.": null, ": Marley? Like what?": null, ": Hate to say it, you got the dreads, so like, fam you got the dreads,": null, "so you know.": null, ": You know Bob Marley? \u266a Don't worry \u266a": null, ": Oh is that like a muggle thing?": null, ": Fam, fam.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, he immediately daps you up.": null, "J: Man, I'm gonna take care you, dog. I'm gonna take care of you. You": null, "rocking with some wild ass people, bro, but I'm gonna take care of you.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Also, like, hey, while we're here...": null, "D: Sam wants to be a part of the Black conversation.": null, ": Oh of course.": null, ":\u00a0Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Hey, hey.": null, "Aabria: He immediately, like, he does the like shoulder open and is": null, "like, \"Yeah, come on.\"": null, "Sam: Hey, hey, while we're here, you're gonna need to let us know, like,": null, "do you have a loctician?": null, "It is very dry here, so": null, "what is the water situation,": null, "because those are looking": null, "really, really good": null, "and very well kept.": null, "- Thank you.": null, "You know what? Let's go rock": null, "up to where we all stay.": null, "But one more thing, both of": null, "you right now, name this place.": null, "(Lou sighs)": null, "- I hate...": null, "The thing that came to my": null, "head was boring as hell.": null, "I was just gonna call": null, "it Salamander Island.": null, "- Yeah, like Fire Island,": null, "Salamander Island. I like it.": null, "- Fire Island sounds kind of tight.": null, "- Fire Island's way better.": null, "I say we call it Fire Island.": null, "- So Fire Island's already a place.": null, "- And it's a very-": null, "- Fire Island 2?": null, "- Fire Island 2.": null, "- Straight up. Welcome to Fire Island 2.": null, "- \"It's kind of tight.\"": null, "And Victor kind of opens up": null, "and moves back to the group.": null, "Tallulah is in conference": null, "with the other person": null, "that's sitting, full buzz,": null, "and now that you see it": null, "and everything's a little closer,": null, "you actually see that there's": null, "a small, like, ramp of ice": null, "that's rapidly melting": null, "that's in a little pool around them": null, "and back where they're coming from,": null, "so that's like a magical": null, "effect on their chair": null, "that allows their motility,": null, "but it is very, very impermanent.": null, "- If they ever break away": null, "from the conversation with Tallulah,": null, "I'll introduce myself to the person": null, "in the ice ramp sled seat.": null, "- Yeah, Tallulah's kind of chatting 'em up": null, "and then you see that the other girl there": null, "is gonna kind of pull Tallulah aside.": null, "And so yeah, the person that's sitting": null, "is kind of just there, like.": null, "- Hi, I'm Evan Kelmp.": null, "- Oh hi, they call me Rev.": null, "- Rev? Nice to meet you.": null, "- Hey, it's so nice to meet you.": null, "- This island probably requires": null, "some pretty incredible magic": null, "to be able to live here.": null, "- Actually, yeah, it does but": null, "that's kind of why we like it.": null, "There are a couple hundred of us": null, "scattered all over the place and-": null, "- All wizards?": null, "- I mean, what do you mean?": null, "Because, like, everyone can": null, "do magic now kind of thing.": null, "- Practicing magic users.": null, "- \"Oh.": null, "Yeah, you're not gonna last": null, "long if you don't do magic here,": null, "but like I don't have one of those.\"": null, "And Rev's going to point at your wand.": null, "- Oh.": null, "- [Brennan] Okay.": null, "- So, um, we'd heard": null, "that this place was good": null, "for creating things which": null, "did not exist before.": null, "Is that how you're able to work magic": null, "without wands effectively?": null, "- Give me a Mark roll.": null, "I'm gonna say, yeah,": null, "let's call the difficulty": null, "on this one 8.": null, "(Erika sighs)": null, "It's rough.": null, "- That's a two.": null, "- It's okay.": null, "You're gonna clock something": null, "but there's not a lot": null, "of like immediately understanding more.": null, "You can go back and think about": null, "it more and put it together.": null, "This was just about what you see and how quickly you process and thin": null, "slice it.": null, "You see that you say that phrase and something lights up in Rev's eyes": null, "that it makes perfect sense but it wasn't a thing that they knew, if": null, "that makes sense.": null, "- Mm. Mm-hm, mm-hm.": null, "- No, I don't think, I don't think it's the place. I think it's sort of,": null, "well, the place called us.": null, "Like some of us that weren't wizards...": null, "Sorry, it feels weird to say that. Like, \"I'm a wizard.\"": null, "Some of us weren't that before, you know, the news dropped, but then you": null, "feel something, like there's somewhere you could be where you could make": null, "things happen and a lot of us just made our way here?": null, "I don't know if the magic is this place or the magic that we, like...": null, "- You only brought the magic that you had inside you.": null, "- Wow.": null, "- Yeah, that.": null, "- And they like slide a little farther forward and are just really close": null, "and they're like, \"Yeah. Oh my god, you've got a little...\"": null, "- Hm?": null, "- Um, two things.": null, "- Yeah, it's both like you're bleeding and the integrity of your": null, "clothing is a little...": null, "- Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.": null, "- Yeah, you guys should come with us. We can get you patched up.": null, "- As we start walking with them, I'll ask Victor and Rev, how did you,": null, "did something alarm when we landed on the shore here?": null, "How were you, are you guys just patrolling or were you aware that new": null, "people had come to the island?": null, "- As you like mentioned patrol, that's exactly what this is. Like Rev is": null, "pushing out": null, "and you can see in the way that this sled-chair generates ice, they": null, "could go incredibly quickly whenever they want and are sort of just": null, "sandbagging to walk with you, to be at your pace.": null, "And Victor has sort of taken up a very back position.": null, "It's the tall dude in the back that's keeping an eye out on things.": null, "And Rev is the one that kind of keeps up the conversation while Tallulah": null, "and that other woman who has not talked to you yet stay in sort of,": null, "like, hushed conversation.": null, "\"Yeah, we actually, we do little patrols,": null, "'cause you know, you kinda hope you wake up, brand new day.": null, "Hope there's some (sighs) little monsters, there's something fun to do.": null, "But you kind of beat us to the punch and that's okay, it's fun. I hope": null, "you guys had a great time. It's nice, right?\"": null, "- Yeah, I'd like to get back into it.": null, "- It was like a really good stretch.": null, "- You know, just like, kind of like flexing muscles that you haven't": null, "flexed in like-": null, "- [Aabria] 100%.": null, "- Yeah, literally I did. I really haven't been out and about that much.": null, "- I've been doing combat, just mostly making like little things happen.": null, "Like reach under your chair, it's like an ice cream cone or something,": null, "but nothing like this.": null, "- Keeping my eyes trained on the new conversation, I'd like to see": null, "whatever I can overhear from Tallulah and the other girl's conversation.": null, "But again, staying visibly present in this conversation.": null, "- Love it. I'm gonna let you pick the stat you want to roll. You let me": null, "know what": null, "foot you're leading with, with your intention here.": null, "- I would say this is just Mark. The last thing I want is to provoke": null, "anybody.": null, "- Sure.": null, "- So he will opt to miss information. It really is like if they say": null, "something loud enough for anyone to reasonably overhear it, I just want": null, "to make sure I'm paying attention.": null, "- It's gonna be Mark DC 10. If you make that, I'm gonna give you the": null, "full complement of the conversation.": null, "- Cool.": null, "- And then range of, like, within five, you'll get some amount of it.": null, "- Great.": null, "I fail. That's a two.": null, "- With a two, I think as you're trying to listen a little bit, you catch": null, "that there is some sort of magical interference.": null, "Like as you're walking and kind of scanning, I think Evan's always": null, "scanning, you see yourself, your group, and you realize for the first": null, "time, that as you all walk and you look at the ground, you see": null, "everyone's shadows and you remember you have yours, too. And just as a": null, "little reminder to the group, a familiar is something that you can": null, "communicate with telepathically and can execute simple commands when": null, "prompted.": null, "- Can I walk in such a way that my shadow falls across the two of them?": null, "- You absolutely can.": null, "- I'll do that and I'll talk to my shadow later.": null, "(Aabria chuckles)": null, "- You go to try to listen, you hear like a magical buffering of that": null, "information and then just sort of cross as Rev leads you through a well": null, "worn path and you're moving from this place of heat and orange and,": null, "like, indistinctness. And as you tighten up into a formation, you make": null, "sure that your shadow falls across this group, which is a completely": null, "normal thing to happen. You'll get more later. What are the rest of you": null, "doing?": null, "- I think Jammer's taking a quick second to try and understand the": null, "terrain a little bit. And I don't think he's verbally, but he's trying": null, "to understand, from where we came really trying to get a sense of where": null, "we're going. Like if he can see whatever structure they're headed to.": null, "But more than anything that if shit pops off that us going back to our": null, "hoopty is not a like, \"Ah, shit, ah,\" that it's like we went left, then": null, "right. Like he's very methodically trying to keep track of how we're": null, "moving through this kind of vague, hazy place.": null, "- Amazing. Mind roll difficulty of 7.": null, "That's a two.": null, "- Okay, then I'm gonna ask you to choose. What's more important, seeing": null, "what's ahead or remembering where you've been?": null, "- Seeing where we've been.": null, "- Okay. You have no sense of the expectation set for this environment.": null, "It's very weird and doesn't seem to have like a natural, \"Well I think I": null, "would expect to see this around the corner.\" You just keep seeing the": null, "terrain change as you're dipping, but you have a great layout of how to": null, "get back. And as you keep moving forward and you see what breaks through": null, "once you come through this rocky outcropping, you will just simply be": null, "surprised. Anything else?": null, "- So as we go along with Rev and I'm on my phone and saying like, okay,": null, "yeah, so like, if you can get through the level with the mushrooms, then": null, "you can find, there's a bunch of PDFs sort of hidden in the clickables": null, "that'll help with sort of, like, potions.": null, "- How do you know?": null, "- Just a theory.": null, "- That's really interesting because I feel like I was on some forums": null, "that were like this. You know, a couple of us that were here and you": null, "know, aren't really here anymore, made our way here through some of the,": null, "like, some of the Itsy forums. And so it's really cool that you've been": null, "on them, too.": null, "- Yes, I know.": null, "- I know quite a bit about it. I've sort of been deeply involved with": null, "that community from the beginning and everything.": null, "- [Aabria] Amazing.": null, "- Yeah. I'm sorry, are you good or do you?": null, "(Danielle clears throat)": null, "- Hi.": null, "- Hi. Yeah, K is a big fan of Itsy.": null, "Real big fan.": null, "- Like whatever, whoever they are, they are doing some real good work.": null, "- 100%, yeah.": null, "- Yeah. So definitely like, you know-": null, "- If you have a-": null, "- The mushroom.": null, "- The mushroom level, you know?": null, "- Why is it a mushroom level, do you think?": null, "- I bet it's because-": null, "- That feel like a very, like, weird for its own sake.": null, "- (stammering) There's like just some deeper meaning that we don't quite": null, "understand. It's like all very thematic, you know, into the whole whimsy": null, "of the nursery rhymes and the fairy tales-": null, "- Nursery rhymes?": null, "- And stuff. Yeah. Haven't you seen kind of, like the-": null, "- Rhonda, did you know there were nursery rhymes?": null, "- It's all themed out.": null, "- Immediately turns and breaks into Tallulah's conversation and you see": null, "Rhonda looks up. This is a heavy-set, sort of wide, broad featured, deep": null, "tan, in that way that's like a tan that was a burn and you get the": null, "muddledness as it starts to wear off. And all of this broadness is": null, "really weirdly contrasted with short, spiky platinum blonde hair. As she": null, "kinda looks up, she's like,": null, "\"What? What do you mean?\"": null, "- I mean like it's all themed out. Even the one that's through the, you": null, "know, the one that's through the fitness side, the get jacked one, and": null, "it's like all of the different Jacks-": null, "- Hold on.": null, "- There's Sprat and-": null, "- \"Shut up.\"": null, "And Rhonda, like Tallulah looks furious as all of a sudden her little": null, "co-conspirator, you mentioned the exact right app.": null, "- She pulls her phone out and starts scrolling through. Like,": null, "\u201cWell where do you meet? This is where I put in all my macros. Like": null, "you're saying there's something else here?\"": null, "- Yeah, so like eat no fat or eat no lean on Saturdays and everything.": null, "- And that's a part of it?": null, "- It's a part of it.": null, "- This is crazy.": null, "- I know.": null, "- Also I'm a huge fan and I've just been trying not to be weird about": null, "- Oh I just assumed like magical island, like nobody here would have TV.": null, "- No, we're all holding the internet. Yeah, it's very cool. Your show's": null, "very cool. I love it.": null, "- Oh, thank you. That's really sweet.": null, "- [Aabria] It's very cool.": null, "- So where are you from?": null, "- Oh I'm from Arizona, so yeah.": null, "- Oh so you're used to this. (laughs)": null, "- It's a dry heat, yeah.": null, "(Danielle laughs)": null, "- Arizona.": null, "- It's very cool, man.": null, "- It's similar. It's very hot.": null, "- Rocky.": null, "- It's really funny because\u2026 what'd you call her? Taytay?": null, "- Taytay.": null, "- Taytay has mentioned you but didn't mention that you were f-": null, "I mean she's\u2026": null, "Didn't mention that you were fun.": null, "Um, yeah.": null, "- Oh my god, what'd she say about us?": null, "- Oh you know she's got some issues from the way I think in which you": null, "left things.": null, "- Yeah, you know that's all like kid stuff, right? That's all, like-": null, "- Yeah, we were so young then.": null, "- Yeah, we were so young. We were like babies. That was what, like three": null, "years ago?": null, "- Yeah, we're ancient now.": null, "- And Tallulah's gonna, like, push forward and sort of sidesteps all of": null, "you and is with Rev and speeds up as you come around the corner and you": null, "see the orange sort of fades away and the rockiness and outcroppings of": null, "this place still exist and there's that little bit of tinge, like, the": null, "sky when there's a fire hundreds of miles away and you get just that": null, "little glow across everything. But you also see now that there are": null, "structures, like bits of rock that are hanging in the sky with": null, "waterfalls coming down and lava falls coming down. And this central": null, "figure that you're being led to is this, like, maybe your distance from": null, "here would say that it's probably, like, 40 or 50 meters across but it's": null, "got two othe little floating islands lashed to it with rope bridges and": null, "it's floating and hovering, and you see edges of green in a way that you": null, "don't see anywhere else around here.": null, "And even from this distance you guys still probably have another 10": null, "minutes of a little bit of a hike. It's flat but rocky and not paved in": null, "any meaningful way. There's no desire paths carved into this place we'll": null, "take to get there, but you can already hear people.": null, "- In the places in the sky?": null, "- Wow. That is so cool.": null, "- [Aabria] Yeah.": null, "(Brennan sighs)": null, "- That's awesome. Magic.": null, "- It's kind of nice, right?": null, "- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's beautiful. The greenery.": null, "- We all did pretty good. We got it done. We took care of that.
