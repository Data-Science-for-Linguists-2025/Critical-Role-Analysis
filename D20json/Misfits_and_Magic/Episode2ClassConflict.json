I truly hate to do it, I'm going to": null, "have to give you a demerit.

I don't understand,": null, "I feel like you did a saying, so isn't just kind of appreciate it.": null, "Evan: No, that's fine.": null, "Boodle: No, I can just, grab your wands really quick. We'll just kind of": null, "teach that... Mr. Kelmp?": null, "Jammer: Are you gonna teach us how to make our poop go away?": null, "Boodle: Oh, it's more of a general-": null, "Jammer: Oh, this removal, yeah.": null, "Boodle: Yeah, it's a removal spell.": null, "Dream: How hazardous is this if this goes wrong?": null, "Boodle:\u00a0[pause] Don't mess up, just don't mess up, okay? Okay, all": null, "right, circle, and you've really got to nail the flick at what you're": null, "trying to get rid of. So hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, I was walking": null, "earlier": null, "Aabria: And he takes off a penny loafer and kind of dumps out some dirt": null, "from his shoe on the ground and divides it into four little piles in": null, "front of you, like, \"Everyone pick a pile.\"": null, "Evan: Is\u00a0this effect destroying it, or sending it somewhere?": null, "Boodle: [shrugs] Mm-mm.": null, "Evan: I'm sorry, is there no theory of magic?

It's fine, they've probably already dealt": null, "with a system of figuring out how to deal with it 'cause we have all": null, "been doing this for a while.

Yeah, I think-": null, "Aabria: Please make a brains roll with a difficulty of 16.": null, "Lou: Oh, okay, so you want me to explode nineteen times in a row?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, that feels right for that.": null, "Lou: Okay, cool. Well, no, that is a 3.

You do not create whole cloth, but you send a massive": null, "spike of iron from deep within the earth's crust, shattering through the": null, "bottom of the dormitory stone floor in front of you. I need the three of": null, "you to make flight rolls with a difficulty of 10 in order to avoid this": null, "nightmare.": null, "Brennan: Any magic added to this, or it's just normal flight?": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna say normal flight, unless you would think to try to": null, "cast magic to get out of the way of something.": null, "Lou: I feel like nobody is, nobody's gonna make it-": null, "Brennan: What's the difficulty, sorry?": null, "Aabria: 10.": null, "Erika: 9.": null, "Brennan: You got 9?": null, "Erika: Yeah.": null, "Danielle: 7.": null, "Erika: I mean, I could burn one, too, but-": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna burn, and you got 7, right?": null, "Danielle: Mm-hmm.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna burn-": null, "Lou: I can't spend them, can I spend them?": null, "Aabria: No.": null, "Lou: Okay.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna burn four to jump and grab Sam and... I'm gone bump": null, "theirs to 10. I rolled a five, so I'm a million miles away from it, but": null, "I'll get Sam and Dream out of the way.": null, "Aabria: I'll allow it. And as you push them out of the way, you feel a": null, "terrible pain, as a little jut of iron pierces your thigh and shoots": null, "directly through it. Evan, your body, whatever you are is so attenuated": null, "to preserving and growing whatever power's dormant within you, so what": null, "happens when your flesh is rent?": null, "Brennan: I scream out loud and say,": null, "Evan: Don't touch my blood!": null, "Brennan: And a roiling snake of blood that bursts out of my leg, I grab": null, "it and just start punching it in the head, and I go,": null, "Evan:\u00a0(screams gibberish)": null, "Aabria: There's now a giant blood cobra.

You got the jump... no, no, no, you": null, "were finishing pushing them, and you are moving towards tackling the": null, "blood cobra, but you're not gonna be the first one to act. You all are": null, "safe and out of the way, as dark blood scatters across the ground,": null, "swirls up into a serpent, looks around, and is going to lunge at Sam.": null, "What do you all do?": null, "Danielle: Okay, don't think I'm gonna be able to charm my way out of": null, "this one, but we'll find out.": null, "Danielle: Sam looks at the blood cobra, (laughs) which is the name of my": null, "new band.": null, "Lou: Pretty sick.": null, "Danielle: And Sam is going to try to talk to the blood cobra.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Give me a charm roll,": null, "we'll go difficulty of 10.": null, "Danielle: Okay, well, then I'll take half and then that hits.": null, "Danielle: So I go to the blood cobra.": null, "Sam: Hey, it's so nice to meet you. I know you when you were previously": null, "inside my friend.": null, "(Brennan roars and mimes a roiling snake)": null, "Sam: So it's like we're friends already, right? We're already buds,": null, "you're in him, we were best friends. So if you want to maybe just go": null, "back inside my friend, because I think you're doing not as much... you": null, "could be doing so much more cool metal stuff if you had a whole body to": null, "get into. So I don't know, just try it and see what you think, if you": null, "just want to go back in, just this. (slurps) I think that that would be": null, "good.": null, "Aabria: The snake, it doesn't respond to you in any way, nor can you see": null, "its eyes to see if there's a ton of sapience there, but it sort of gets": null, "lulled by your lack of a heightened response, and it kind of matches": null, "your energy after a time. It goes back to the ground and slowly begins": null, "to move back in the rivulet, up Evan's leg, and back into his body.": null, "Sam: Hey, how you feeling, bud?": null, "Evan: Thank you so much.": null, "Sam: Oh, you're welcome.": null, "Evan: That was incredible.": null, "Sam: Yeah, that was kind of scary.": null, "Dream: Oh my God, oh my God, that was really awesome. You sacrificed": null, "yourself for us, oh my God, oh my God!": null, "Erika: And Dream just launches herself, like full body, sort of hugs": null, "onto Evan and taps at the, pokes at the wound with her wand to close it": null, "up and heal it up.": null, "Aabria: Do you know how to do healing magic?": null, "Erika: No.": null, "Aabria: Cool, all right, go ahead and make a brains roll, difficulty of": null, "14, for me.": null, "Lou: Are we gonna do this again? All right-": null, "Aabria: Yeah, I don't know why y'all didn't go to at least one fucking": null, "class before you're like, gonna do a lot of magic here.": null, "Lou: Hey, I sent baby powder out of my wand. I can do this, I can": null, "summon-": null, "Erika: What is the target I gotta hit?": null, "Aabria: Move a tiny amount of dirt and you're like, \u201cGot it, master": null, "wizard.\u201d": null, "Jammer: Yeah, we honestly killed that dirt thing, and I honestly think": null, "that's part of the reason.

You have to know-": null, "Erika: Oh, I gotta do the magic spell.": null, "Aabria: The spell.": null, "Erika: Okay, fuck.": null, "Erika: Nine.

I'm gonna deal with that, please go to": null, "class and don't do magic until you've gone to classes, please. You know": null, "what, I'm sorry, I really like you and I appreciate that we have a whole": null, "vibe here, but please, you made a giant, and then the blood came out of": null, "that, so please join Ms. Tanaka.

If we pass the class, do we also get": null, "to go and just tree rub?": null, "Aabria: And she tucks one of the branches under her arm and takes the": null, "other one and snaps it in half and just offers you half of it, there you": null, "go.": null, "Danielle: And I take it.

(laughs)": null, "Sam: I love vibes, yeah, just big vibes-": null, "The Frunthwinkle: Glad you feel that from you, and you just, why do you": null, "have a rock around your neck?": null, "Sam: Oh, this is a quartz, it's a quartz crystal. It's just for when you": null, "want to do a little bit of intention magic, this is-": null, "The Frunthwinkle: Intention magic? Oh, is that new?": null, "The Frunthwinkle: Show me.": null, "Sam: Okay, so I have this book, right?

So now, is the magic, is it magic,": null, "or are you just putting something into the front of your mind so you can": null, "actively seek it?": null, "Sam: It's magic, but not the kind of magic that we do here, it's the": null, "kind of magic that you don't realize that you've done this until it's a": null, "year later, and then you're at a show, and someone's like, \"Hey, you're": null, "really cool,\" and you're like, \"See, magic,\" magicked it, magicked all": null, "over it.": null, "The Frunthwinkle: Vibes, okay, I like that, I like that for you.

You'll come see me tomorrow, yeah?": null, "The Frunthwinkle: You should cast magic now or then, whenever, nothing": null, "matters, (overlapping chattering) but everything has meaning and": null, "purpose. Do you understand me?": null, "Danielle: I'm gonna cast a spell. And so Sam intends to cast a spell": null, "that will make it so the one branch becomes two branches.": null, "Aabria: Ooh.": null, "Danielle: All right.": null, "Aabria: Okay, let's call that, yeah, dang it, I can't give you anything": null, "better than that... no, no, no, I'm gonna call this a grit roll.

Okay, yep, I got the 10.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, why don't you narrate for me what it looks like?": null, "Danielle: Okay, so out of the point of the wand, there starts to be": null, "bamboo that comes, or the branches of the eucalyptus, you see first a": null, "small tree, and then it climbs up and gets bigger and fuller, until it's": null, "a fully formed branch, which is connected here, and I just snap it off,": null, "and now I've got two.": null, "The Frunthwinkle: That's amazing.": null, "Evan: That was beautiful.": null, "The Frunthwinkle: It's times are right, can I hold? 'Cause you're about": null, "to experience something, and I don't want branches to hold you back,": null, "okay? Thank you.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she takes the branches, and then she grabs both of them.": null, "They reform into a singular branch in her hand.": null, "The Frunthwinkle: You're gonna want to look at your wand.": null, "Aabria: And the transformation that's it's been going through finally": null, "completes itself, and your wand is fully formed and fully realized.": null, "(group shrieks)": null, "Lou: These are the best reveals.
