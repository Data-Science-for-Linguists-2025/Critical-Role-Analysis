She just gives a little nod. Everything about her is that feral": null, "form.": null, "Oscar: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: And this feels very much like her sort of protector instinct as": null, "the ground is literally rumbling and something strange and powerful is": null, "happening, and despite whatever you've gone through, she would never": null, "leave you unprotected. And you keep going by, and you know, even though": null, "you can't hear it through the rain and the storm and the beating of your": null, "own heart, she is following. All right, my other two. How's it going?": null, "You're just hanging out?": null, "Surena: No.": null, "Aabria: You're able to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge these plants.": null, "Surena: I'd like to see if I can find a caster, where they're coming": null, "from. Like, who is controlling these plants?": null, "Aabria: Give me an Arcana check.": null, "Surena: Great, okay. Oh god, doesn't count, doesn't count. Oh, should've": null, "counted. That is a 11.": null, "Aabria: You could always burn a token to succeed.": null, "Surena: What is this boy?": null, "Aabria: Who could say?": null, "Surena: Who could say? Yeah, I feel like my life is in danger and your": null, "life is in danger, Andhera, so I take a quick scan of everything and I": null, "burn the token.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Good, yes, good, burn them all. You, again, reach": null, "towards something powerfully arcane within yourself, and you feel and": null, "you look at these plants. There is no caster.": null, "Surena: Okay.": null, "Aabria: The plants themselves are deeply magical, and you reach towards": null, "that sense that you have, lost places and hidden things, and you're able": null, "to sort of see and follow the roots, deep and powerful and strong, under": null, "the ground, shooting off in a direction. You actually see where all of": null, "these other plants were popping up in and around this area in the": null, "theater. They're all leading in one direction towards something very": null, "powerfully arcane that you can kind of see with your arcane vision off": null, "back behind the theater stage itself, and you know that that's the": null, "direction of Lord Airavis, and that your friends are probably headed in.": null, "It all originates there.": null, "BINX: We have to go back to the theater. It's not safe here.": null, "Surena: And I'm dodging vines.": null, "Omar: Have I overcome my distraction?": null, "Aabria: Yes, because you've pushed it into the earth, and this": null, "earthquake, and as things are sort of shifting and moving, you're not": null, "sure if it's entirely because of you, but something about that energy": null, "sparked. It was that last little catalyst of strange, chaotic magic": null, "that's been pushed into the world that is causing all of this change.": null, "Omar: I look to you, and I grab both ends of my double bladed scimitar": null, "and I click them together and lock them, so my weapon is prepared.": null, "Andhera: Are you feeling okay?": null, "BINX: It's hard for me to breathe.": null, "Omar: I, without even hearing any more, I put a hand on her shoulder and": null, "I cast Protection from Poison.": null, "Surena: Aw, okay.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera: Nothing can happen to you.": null, "Surena: At that, I take out my crossbow.
