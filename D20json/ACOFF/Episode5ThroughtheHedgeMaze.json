It looks like your sister": null, "really wants it.": null, "Andhera: Well, we'll have to see if she's\u2014": null, "Chirp:\u00a0If you\u2014": null, "Andhera: Hmm?": null, "Chirp:\u00a0You know what?": null, "Andhera: Hm.": null, "Chirp: I'd love to see your sister swallow a loss to you.": null, "Emily: And I give him the Potion of Speed.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "Chirp: Consider it a boon.": null, "Andhera: Thank you very much.": null, "Chirp: You're welcome.": null, "Omar: And I grab one of the other vials and kinda clink it,": null, "Andhera: Bottoms up!": null, "Omar: And I down one of the orange ones and I wander off.": null, "Emily: [laughs] What does orange do?": null, "Lou: That's poison.

You definitely know which ones those were, 'cause": null, "Wannessa was absolutely weak to it when you saw it.": null, "Oscar: That's right.": null, "Surena: Very similarly to Hob, I think that Gwyndolin, in her": null, "ridiculously so much cloth dress, she also has bell sleeves.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Surena: So I would like to wave my bell sleeves over, and just take the": null, "remainder of the potions in our little area.": null, "Surena: So it's all but Plants and Encode Thoughts.": null, "Aabria: Okay, yeah, sweet.

There's no check for this, but you are in a hedge maze and you": null, "know there are dozens upon dozens of other Archfey here. You know that": null, "at the center lies the Crystal Heart, but where do you want to go in": null, "this maze?": null, "Lou: I mean, with the prodding from my cousin earlier, I do think a": null, "little bit of old Squak is out and just thinking, \"Oh, what if I just": null, "made a mess? Just a big, old mess.\" And so I think I'm seeking scandal": null, "and ruin.": null, "Emily: Yeah, baby.": null, "Aabria: Yes. Do you have a target in mind as the hedge begins to rustle": null, "behind you?": null, "Lou: I think the Court of Wonder generally, Prince Apollo maybe more": null, "specifically. I think that's\u2014given the moment we were in and kind of": null, "just the general chatter that has been around the Court of Wonder, and I": null, "think the end, I think, some of my efforts in the previous days, that's": null, "who has my eye in this moment.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, you feel a little bit of a wind blow. It ducks right": null, "below the height of the hedge and blows you to the right and you, being": null, "a Lord of the Wing, you understand that this wind is deeply arcane and": null, "blowing you towards chaos and ruin.": null, "Squak: [laughs] Well, lead the way.": null, "Lou: I'm gonna\u2014I'll follow.": null, "Aabria: I need you to make a roll for me. I'm gonna let you decide what": null, "kind of roll this is to navigate through the maze to find someone of": null, "interest.": null, "Emily: I love seeing my cousin work.": null, "Lou: I mean, would you take Survival or would you take\u2014": null, "Aabria: Yeah, I think this is Survival or Investigation or Perception.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: Even Arcana because you know this is a deeply magical situation.": null, "Lou: Skip that one, skip that one, skip that one.": null, "Aabria: Could be nature.": null, "Lou: Skip that one.": null, "Aabria: I don't know why I'm giving\u2014yeah, okay.

You always trust the birds. And yeah, you": null, "let the wind kind of bolster under you, and I think because of the": null, "nature of your gifts and your talents and your magic, you're even more": null, "sensitive to the slight suggestion of the wind as you very quickly find": null, "yourself not just walking, but almost at like a jog moving quickly,": null, "deciding authoritatively left and right and left again. And you find": null, "yourself standing around the corner probably 20 feet away from Prince": null, "Apollo himself, a figure of almost all burnished gold. He looks": null, "statuesque. His skin and hair gleam in the setting sun. And you see he's": null, "got wraps of vines around his hand and a small arcane focus that he's": null, "gripping, this golden spike as he's trying to blast a straight line": null, "through the hedge to get to the center, but the hedge is not giving up": null, "without a fight.": null, "Lou: Oh. [laughs]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What do you wanna do?": null, "Lou: What do I want to do? I think I'm going to aid him.

Or excuse me, yeah, 14 points of damage.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, beautiful.": null, "Lou: From the center of my forehead. And then I think I'm going to run": null, "up. That's just a bonus action.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Yeah, I was gonna say.": null, "Lou: So then I will run up and actually attempt to aid. [laughs]": null, "Aabria: Are you attacking the monstrous bit of hedge in front of you or": null, "are you trying to ungrapple Apollo?": null, "Lou: I think I will actually use\u2014so I will use my forehead bald eagle to": null, "attack the vines itself, and then I'm going to run up and give Prince": null, "Apollo the help action for whatever he would like to do on his turn.": null, "Emily: Ooh!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So good.": null, "Squak: Prince, let me help you!": null, "Apollo: Lord Airavis, this hedge sucks!": null, "Squak: Yeah, Prince, it is a foul beast. Did you see what it did to that": null, "beautiful, beautiful bird earlier?": null, "Apollo: The water bird?": null, "Squak: It's still a bird! As long as\u2014": null, "Apollo: You got your revenge. I saw that beautiful spiritual eagle.": null, "Squak: Yes.": null, "Apollo: Thank you, hold please.": null, "Aabria: And he head-butts the hedge and is going to cast Blight.": null, "Aabria: And begins to burn it away, but he burns one of his higher level": null, "spell slots doing so.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Great.": null, "Aabria: And the hedge sort of corrodes and darkens as a hole opens up": null, "between you, and he's kind of pulling the dead vines off of his hand and": null, "arms and goes,": null, "Apollo: Come here often?": null, "Squak: [laughs] Well, I do consider myself to be quite comfortable in a": null, "hedge maze. I like the privacy.": null, "Apollo: Incredible. So are you a friend or a competitor?": null, "Squak: [chuckles] Why can't I be both?": null, "Emily:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "Surena: Okay.": null, "Squak: A little bit of help, a little bit of harm. We can do it all.": null, "Apollo: An interesting prospect. Well, since I would still be struggling": null, "with this terrible bush were it not for you, after you.": null, "Squak: Oh, no, no, no. After you.": null, "Aabria: And without demurring any more he steps through into the next": null, "layer of the hedge.": null, "Lou: Right, I follow.": null, "Aabria: All right, next up we've got Andhera. So you push into the": null, "hedge. You find yourself alone.": null, "Omar: Queasy as fuck.": null, "Lou: Or did you empty your bowels as soon as you got in? And is that": null, "your turn? Do you need to shit yourself?": null, "Emily: Oh wait, if we're not allowed to fly in the hedge maze, are we": null, "allowed to take a giant dump in the hedge maze?": null, "Aabria: You gotta find out. Does a plant think like, \u201coh, an offering,": null, "how wonderful\u201d?": null, "Emily: Compost.": null, "Aabria: There you go. A little fertilizer.": null, "Omar: I'm not taking a shit in the hedge maze.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I don't know, but\u2014": null, "Oscar: You could. No one's watching.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That makes sense if you have to\u2014": null, "Lou: When's that next rumor phase? Andhera...": null, "Omar: I can cast magic on myself. I don't have to do that. I can use a": null, "spell.": null, "Lou: I don't know.": null, "Omar: I'm going to go ahead. I'm gonna cast Lesser Restoration on": null, "myself.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you can absolutely cure yourself.": null, "Omar: And that settles my stomach. And is this all moving sort of as if": null, "we were doing rounds of combat, so that is a spell I used?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, yes.": null, "Omar: And so I stand and I go,": null, "Andhera: Shit, I could have fucking called my horse.": null, "Aabria: Well then, in and around that, as you sort of settle your": null, "stomach and settle into the hedge... What are you looking for in here?": null, "Omar: I'm not sure. That's, I think, my answer is I'm competing for the": null, "sake of being a part of the event. And the Glass Heart itself could": null, "absolutely bring an air of decorum to my presence in general in the": null, "Unseelie Court, but I'm not... I don't have a strategy. I'm not really": null, "seeking out any sort of particular interaction. Andhera feels like a": null, "tinge, like a little slight stab of pain that is fear of just...": null, "uncertainty. No idea exactly what they're really gonna do so they're": null, "just gonna sort of... I'm used to caverns that just sort of snake": null, "through a mountain, and so I'm just gonna do the strategy of putting my": null, "hand against one of the walls and just going.": null, "Aabria: Give me\u2026 you pick the roll.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: I need some sort of check to begin navigating.": null, "Omar: Perfect, let's go with... Insight.": null, "Omar: Yeah, let's go with Insight. Okay, 15.": null, "[soft instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: 15's pretty good. You put your hand up against the outer wall": null, "and begin to walk, and as your fingertips sort of pass over the leaves,": null, "you sense a pattern. And there's a sense of feedback here that you're": null, "noticing something very much alive and deeply magical that is trying to": null, "probe you for a direction, and you are able to feel that it's trying to": null, "reach out bouncing off of your, not indifference, but your unwillingness": null, "to make a decision here and rebound back to it. And every time you turn": null, "a corner, you see three new portals and directions open and shut. This": null, "is a very frenetic maze to you because it's giving you all of these": null, "possibilities. And as you pass by some portals, you hear voices and the": null, "sounds of people that you know that you've just met, and people that": null, "you've known your entire life. And then, more often than not, the sort": null, "of deep quiet of the turns of a maze that would lead eventually to the": null, "center.": null, "Omar: I want to hold my palms up against the leaves themselves and just": null, "kind of whisper into the hedge.": null, "Andhera: What do you want to\u2014what do you want?": null, "Aabria: I love this Insight check so I'm going to take it into": null, "consideration, but I do need you to make\u2026 Make an Arcana check for me on": null, "top of it.": null, "Omar: Okay, great. That is going to be a total of 23. How's that? I've": null, "never played before.": null, "Aabria: It's fine.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Is that good?": null, "Brennan: \u201cDid I break it?\u201d": null, "Omar: Thank you, I looked for this die. It was very good.": null, "Emily: I put all their dice in the new moon and they have been": null, "delivering.": null, "Aabria: Not mine! Mine rolled three 2s when I tried to warm 'em up": null, "today.": null, "Emily:\u00a0I\u2019m sorry.": null, "Brennan: Nobody wants the DM to roll well.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0No one, yeah.": null, "Brennan: No one wants to see it.": null, "Emily: Even the new moon.": null, "Aabria: Mine are cursed and that is fucked up.": null, "Lou: The moon is with us.": null, "Emily: Oh, yeah!": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you feel, with a 23, a sense of looking and longing and": null, "purposefulness. And it resolves quite clearly into a thought to find the": null, "one that's worthy.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "Omar: That is interesting.": null, "Aabria: And even as you're just sort of with your hands up and touching,": null, "everywhere you go the verdancy of this place assaults you. And even": null, "still in this hedge, the leaves are getting greener, the hedge gets a": null, "little higher as you walk, but these leaves seem to be growing and": null, "curling gently around your hands, blossoming under your touch.": null, "Andhera: I'm now realizing that my strategy of putting my hand up": null, "against a wall and tracing it will not quite work because you can move": null, "[laughs] so that actually\u2014that wouldn't do what I would hope it would": null, "do. So I'm going to just sit here.": null, "Omar: And I plop down.": null, "Andhera: Because I'm going to call forth a steed, and that's gonna take": null, "a couple minutes. And I'm going to feed my steed.": null, "Omar: And I pull out the vial that Lady Chirp gave to me.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, yes.": null, "Andhera: Just to get a really fast horse in here.": null, "[Aabria laughing]": null, "Brennan: Galloping through a hedge maze. Step aside.": null, "Emily: That's why I gave it to him. [laughs]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You will kill countless.": null, "Andhera: I'm used to being sort of alone and just sitting in places. And": null, "while I'm doing this, 'cause it'll take a while to cast, feel free to": null, "comb my thoughts and memories and feast upon them, I suppose. I hold": null, "nothing from you.": null, "Aabria: And even as you sit, and your hands kind of come away as you're": null, "giving yourself a nice little place and you begin to cast your spell, a": null, "little vine kind of creeps out and just wraps ever so gently around your": null, "shoe. And you feel your mind being, not like rifled through, but just": null, "sort of soothed. And the one memory you feel being pulled up, it's not a": null, "memory, it's sort of a realization that though your family and your": null, "court are incredibly storied and well-regarded, your mother's sort of": null, "refusal to engage with the primary conceit of the Bloom means that no": null, "one in your family has ever been in possession of the Crystal Heart. And": null, "it isn't to say that this hedge wants you to pursue it. It doesn't want": null, "anything of you, but it does give you just a little peek as somewhere": null, "far away in the strange geometries of a magical hedge, you see your": null, "sister sprinting through trying to find her way to the center.": null, "Andhera: Interesting, okay. Well, I'm gonna sit here. I'm gonna summon": null, "the horse. Thank you for sharing that. And also, just so you know, I": null, "would never take a shit in you. That is so disgusting.": null, "Aabria: You get a little like, [shrugs] plant.": null, "Andhera: I still wouldn't, but good to know.": null, "Aabria: And from there, [Lou rips a piece of paper] we move over to\u2014": null, "[laughing] Gwyndolin. That was such an authoritative rip. I thought I": null, "had done something wrong.": null, "Lou: I just didn't want to interrupt the scene, but I've needed to rip": null, "that paper for a long time.": null, "Emily: That was the worst rip of paper I've ever seen. Hold up that": null, "paper shard and admit what you've done.": null, "Oscar: The shard.": null, "Surena: It's a paper shard.": null, "Lou holds up a badly ripped blank page.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Disgusting!": null, "Lou: I don't need a perfect page, okay.": null, "Aabria: Well, you didn't get one. All right, Gwyn.": null, "Surena: Okay, so in Gwyn's mind, BINX is thinking, right?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Surena: BINX\u00a0is like,": null, "BINX: All right. I just have to go in there and I need an ally. I need": null, "to find Rue immediately. I think they would understand. They would know.": null, "They would understand, and they're not like the others. They're not like": null, "the others, so I'm gonna\u2014yeah, I'm gonna find them.": null, "Surena: And so that is what I wanna do, but I understand that Rue isn't": null, "technically in the hedge maze yet so\u2014": null, "Aabria: We're assuming that everyone's entering at different\u2014yeah.": null, "Surena: Okay, great. And so I am going to, using the knowledge that BINX": null, "knows from a coloring book she found that was like a child\u2019s activity": null, "book maze, understanding how mazes work, she touches the wall of the": null, "maze and goes left and is just touching the wall and trying to follow it": null, "to see if she can sense... [gasps] Are you glittery? What is\u2014do you have": null, "anything of you?": null, "Oscar: Am I glittery?": null, "Surena: That I can track. [laughs]": null, "Oscar: I do have a peony.": null, "Aabria: I cast Locate Glitter.": null, "Oscar: On my head, that I touched using the green potion, and it like,": null, "bloomed, so if you can smell\u2014": null, "Surena: Ooh, okay.": null, "Oscar: Peonies, you\u2019ll probably...": null, "Surena: Perfect, so in touching the wall, BINX/Gwyn starts trying to": null, "smell for the flower, yeah.": null, "Aabria: Okay, I need you to give me a roll if you're trying to track": null, "down a peony by stink in a green maze.": null, "Surena: Oh yeah, that's hard.": null, "Aabria: You can give me an Investigation or a Perception check. If you": null, "want it to be a different kind of roll, you tell me what you're rolling.": null, "Surena: What is the ground like? Are there footprints? Are there so many": null, "footprints?": null, "Aabria: It is just grassy. And you see no other footprints. It's as": null, "though you entered this part of the maze alone.": null, "Surena: Okay, so as I'm going through the maze with the greenery of the": null, "maze, are there different flowers of the maze?": null, "Aabria: Mm-hmm.": null, "Surena: Is there a spot in the maze that looks more luscious, more": null, "vibrant, colorful? I want to go towards that.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, I'll say there's an area where most of it is just that": null, "solid green, and then kind of spilling out over the top of the maze, of": null, "part of the hedge, is a cascade of sunny, yellow orchids.": null, "Surena: Perfect, I'm gonna run towards those orchids and see if I can": null, "find Rue.": null, "Surena: Yeah, rolling search Rue. Rolling Perception, probably.": null, "Surena: Natural 20!": null, "[Brennan cheering] [players clapping]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Amazing!": null, "Surena: Yes, oh my God!": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Wow, oh my God!": null, "Aabria: You come in with a pure driving intent.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria: And as you spot those flowers drooping down over the hedge, you": null, "run for them, and you see them sort of fall down as if dead, and then": null, "the vine they were growing from regrows a massive pink peony. And as you": null, "run and you're moving left and right, everywhere flowers would be": null, "blooming up or out or down, the blooms fall dead and regrow as peonies": null, "in Rue's direction.": null, "Surena: Oh my gosh, okay. So understanding that the maze is kind of the": null, "most secluded place that we've been in so far, right?": null, "Surena: Because everything is shifting and changing, I think that BINX": null, "finds you, runs up to you.": null, "Aabria: Yeah.": null, "Gwyndolin: Hi, um...": null, "Rue: Oh, uh, Lady Thistle-hop, you found me!": null, "Gwyndolin: I did, um... I wanted to tell you that what you did was": null, "amazing. Well, what you showed... Who, [sighs] who you showed yourself": null, "to be... is amazing, and I needed you to know that. And also, I don't": null, "think that you're like the other people from the Court of Wonder, are": null, "you? You're not like them, right?": null, "Aabria: The hedge closes behind you and in front of you. You are now in": null, "a 10-by-10-foot secluded private cube as the hedge gives you space.": null, "[tender instrumental music]": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Privacy.": null, "Gwyndolin: You're not like them. You're different.": null, "Rue: Them meaning...": null, "Gwyndolin: Our\u2014your court.": null, "Rue: [sighs] I know, I suppose I'm not like the Court of Wonder.": null, "Gwyndolin: Right.": null, "Rue: And...": null, "Gwyndolin: So I... I'm trusting you because you trusted all of us, okay?": null, "And I need you to not freak out, so like, whatever you're gonna see": null, "right now just like\u2014just be cool. Like, don't freak out. Like, it's": null, "fine\u2014": null, "Oscar: I put a\u2014": null, "Gwyndolin: Like, just be fine.": null, "Oscar: A hand on her shoulder, comforting, gently so.": null, "Gwyndolin: Uh-huh.": null, "Oscar: I look intently into your eyes and I say...": null, "Rue: Tell me.": null, "Surena: And with that the glamor starts to shift and shimmer away, and": null, "you see your hand is here. Your hand kind of shrinks down to a smaller": null, "moth girl essentially. You know, she has her earth-tone wings, messy": null, "black hair. She has these branch golden streaks across her chest. BINX": null, "has revealed herself to you and she says,": null, "BINX: I am not of the Court of Wonder, as you can see. I am, um... I am": null, "of the, um... [crying] I'm the last one of the Court of Craft. I'm the": null, "last, final. There was no more blankets left. Just me, I was last. And": null, "so, I'm here to, um... to find where our magic went. And I think that": null, "you're not like them, because they stole it. The Court of Wonder stole": null, "it. They stole all of it, so, um... And I made a mistake. I think I... I": null, "think that there has been some mis\u2014like, there's been some confusion,": null, "and I want to make it right, and I need somebody that I can trust. I": null, "feel like that's you, okay? So like, oh boy. I don't get emotional. I": null, "don't know what's happening right now. My face is leaking! Um...": null, "[exhales]": null, "BINX: It's okay, we're fine. I just...": null, "Rue: May I say this?": null, "BINX: Yes, please talk.": null, "Rue: It is difficult showing one's true self.": null, "BINX: Yeah.": null, "Rue: Especially to someone you've never met before.": null, "Rue: But I will tell you right now, you and I have a connection and you": null, "have full support from me.": null, "BINX: Thank you.": null, "Rue: I thank you for allowing me to see you. It is an honor that I will": null, "never disgrace.": null, "BINX: That means so much to me. Do you have that key I gave you? That": null, "key?": null, "Rue: Well yes, of course.": null, "BINX: Can I see it right now? Just\u2014can you give me that key, please?": null, "Rue: Of course, yes. This key, I wrote you a letter saying, \"I hope you": null, "give me the key to your friendship.\"": null, "BINX: Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. So this is cursed": null, "and I'm so sorry!": null, "Surena: And I take it and I stomp on it.": null, "Rue: My dear, what?": null, "Aabria: I mean, give it back 'cause it still goes in the box, but yeah,": null, "that's great.": null, "BINX: And so I didn't, like I thought\u2014": null, "Rue: It's cursed?": null, "BINX: Well, it was.": null, "Rue: You gave me a cursed key?!": null, "BINX: Listen! I thought you were, you know...": null, "Aabria: The hedge is getting higher and starting to grow over you like,": null, "\u201cuh-oh, up, up!\u201d": null, "BINX: So, I thought you\u2014": null, "Rue: I can't believe you gave me a cursed key!": null, "BINX: No, I mean, I thought you were different.": null, "Rue: I allowed you into, I said\u2014": null, "BINX: I thought you were like, so fancy.": null, "Rue: \"Oh, you can open the lock to our friendship.\"": null, "BINX: But I thought that was fake.": null, "Rue: And you gave me the key and I thought it was so sweet, I thought it": null, "was so kind.": null, "BINX: I thought you were being a phony baloney.": null, "Rue: And you, and you\u2014": null, "Aabria: We're cutting from there and checking in on Captain Hob.": null, "[laughs]": null, "Brennan: Whew! Oh, wow. That's so funny. Maybe like minutes ago back on": null, "the beach, Captain Hob was in a state of a little bit of disarray. He's": null, "in that state of disarray no longer.": null, "[calm instrumental music]": null, "Brennan: The most affected that I have been today is at Rue's": null, "transformation, 'cause I think that moved Hob from a position of \u201coh,": null, "this regal master of ceremonies, this titan of the Court of Wonder was": null, "so disgusted by my offer of affection that they sent their assistant to": null, "come duel me.\u201d And then seeing Rue's transformation, I think I have": null, "actually gotten some closure, and I think still arrived at a wrong": null, "conclusion, but I think Hob went like, what Rue was going through was so": null, "much more massive, and it just wasn't about you.": null, "Like, you just didn't matter to that person. Like, that person was": null, "wrestling with stuff that you could not have understood, and you had": null, "ideas about how much you mattered to this person that were the height of": null, "arrogance. And it was, you know, the Bloom has been about so much more": null, "important things to them, and you were like a fool to elevate your": null, "station to the point that you very much mattered to this person when": null, "they had the definition of other things on their plate.": null, "So, I think Hob was like, \"You are a fool, that's all right.\" And is": null, "touched by their act of bravery and more smitten than before by an order": null, "of magnitude, but is very much like, the door is closed on that. Like,": null, "that was about them and you were\u2014it would be amazing if they even": null, "remembered you, or it clearly was not important. So I think that closure": null, "allows Hob, as the Crystal Heart is announced, that he is unburdened by": null, "distraction. He has found the threat to his court, or so he believes. He": null, "has all those papers of the Court of Wonder.": null, "Brennan: Being collected and waiting for him back, and you know, I think": null, "in my head I just go like,": null, "Captain Hob: An end to distraction, Captain. The Crystal Heart.": null, "Brennan: But the Crystal Heart is not what he desires as he goes into": null, "the maze. He desires the same thing he instructed all of his Salt": null, "Goblins to desire, which is the other goblins. And as he enters the maze": null, "I think I go,": null, "Captain Hob: The goblins.": null, "Brennan: And that's what he is attempting to find as he enters the maze.": null, "Aabria: Okay, before you make your roll to navigate the maze, I need you": null, "to make an Insight check on yourself.": null, "[players gasping]": null, "Emily: Ooh, oh.": null, "Surena: What does that mean?": null, "Oscar: Check yourself before you wreck yourself.": null, "Brennan: I am not good at Insight.": null, "Omar: We are our own enemies.": null, "Aabria: Against your own Deception.": null, "Brennan: Against my own Deception. [gasps] Okay, let's go, in that case,": null, "green is Deception, pink is Insight.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Love it.": null, "Brennan: Oh my God, green plus 2 Deception is\u2014": null, "Emily: 5.": null, "Brennan: Is 5. Pink, a 5 on the die plus 1 for 6.": null, "Brennan: I see myself!": null, "Aabria: And in that moment, you are saying aloud your orders in that way": null, "that soldiers know that once it is put before you, there is nothing to": null, "do but pursue it. And even as you say it, and maybe there's a bit of the": null, "magic of this place showing you yourself as well, you get just a little": null, "breeze that ruffles the hedges, that comes across your nose and you": null, "smell peonies.": null, "Brennan: I stop in my tracks. I look in the direction of the wind that": null, "was carrying that scent. Do I see anything?": null, "Aabria: This is where I need the roll. You can decide what you want to": null, "roll. If you use Arcana, I will give you advantage.": null, "Brennan: Okay.": null, "Aabria: Or Nature, either one.": null, "Lou: [whispering] See, how many dice does he pick up?": null, "Oscar: [whispering] I think he picked up two.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Did he pick two?": null, "Brennan: These are gonna be low rolls, but I will roll Arcana.": null, "Lou: Oh, wow.": null, "Oscar: That's some...": null, "Lou: He did the math in his head like the statistics and I think he": null, "chose it that way.": null, "Emily: Ooh baby.": null, "Lou: Oh, he got a dirty 20.": null, "Brennan: I rolled a 19 on the die. Dirty 20 plus 1.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The breeze moved\u2014": null, "Oscar: It's like a golf announcer.": null, "Lou: He rolled a dirty 20!": null, "Aabria: The breeze moves from left to right and your head instinctually": null, "snaps left in the direction of the breeze. And what you see is a hedge": null, "closed, but strangely this beautiful growing and deepening domed top is": null, "on the far side of it 20 feet away.": null, "[Brennan sighs]": null, "Aabria: As you're thinking, 'cause that was a pretty close set of rolls,": null, "behind you as you turn and face this strange corner of the maze, you": null, "hear, very faintly, the sound of goblins giggling and running. They seem": null, "to be having a good time, and sort of scampering about, but that seems a": null, "little farther away.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0This is heartbreaking.": null, "Aabria: But it's there.": null, "[somber piano music]": null, "Brennan: Hob on his digitigrade legs, those cat-like legs that have the": null, "ankle come up so just the tip of the paw is sort of what touches the": null, "ground. He was already pressing into the earth about to take a step in": null, "the direction of the dome. Due to pure enchantment, the smell of": null, "peonies, he didn't even\u2014he was reacting before he could think, there was": null, "something deeper and more profound at work than orders.": null, "And then he hears the goblins. And I think had he not heard the goblins,": null, "this story would take a different turn. But the chattering of the": null, "goblins sounds enough like laughter, and a reproachful laughter of scorn": null, "and derision, and he remembers that the last time there was a challenge": null, "of the Bloom, he forsook his duty to make room for something greater and": null, "his reward was scorn and humiliation. And I think he turns to join the": null, "goblins, and in that moment knows himself a coward.": null, "Aabria: You turn, and you hear just [mimics wind howling] as a gust of": null, "wind blows you in the direction of the goblins. And looking back over": null, "your shoulder, the way is closed. The hedges fall in on themselves, and": null, "there is no way back, only forward, and you walk for a couple minutes,": null, "and you find seven or eight goblins ranging from small Salt Goblins to": null, "medium-sized, all sort of circling around Viscountess Grabalba as she's": null, "looking back and forth and going,": null, "Grabalba: [clapping] I would like to find the jarl.

[claps]": null, "Aabria: And I think the person you're able to see, just sort of as you": null, "look over your shoulder as the hedge closes behind you, is Lady": null, "Sylmenar, one of the ladies in waiting to Queen Titania from the Seelie": null, "Court.": null, "Emily: And they were looking for me?": null, "Chirp: Oh, actually, while you're here. I have you on the Bluetooth.": null, "Isn't that fun?": null, "Hedge: Oh, that's fun. This is fun for us.": null, "Aabria: It actually curls around so it grows just a little bit into your": null, "ear.": null, "Chirp: Fantastic, this has been my essence all along. Who were the two": null, "people? Lady Sylmenar is one. And who was the other one? Did you catch": null, "their name or a physical description?": null, "Hedge: I didn't catch their name, but they're a bird person.": null, "Oscar: Oh.": null, "Chirp: What?": null, "Hedge: I see them moving around.

It's someone that arrived with you.": null, "Aabria: And they give a physical description of a sort of long-necked,": null, "long-beaked stately bird in fussy clothes and you recognize the": null, "description to be of Caw, your fixer that's here with you.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Hmm...": null, "Chirp: What is Caw doing partaking in games? Thank you so much.": null, "Hedge: You're welcome.

I'm so sorry.": null, "Chirp: Are you kidding me? In 58 minutes our friendship is over?": null, "Hedge: I mean, I'll still like you probably, but I think maybe less of": null, "the talking part.": null, "Chirp: Ah, I just don't know how to... I just, I guess tell me your": null, "story and I'll write it down and turn it into a children's book.": null, "Hedge: Oh my God, I was born a blade of grass.": null, "Aabria: Move on from there.": null, "Brennan: Ship Chirp and the hedge?": null, "Omar: Yeah!": null, "Oscar: Absolutely do.": null, "Surena: I feel...": null, "Omar: Oh.": null, "Brennan: Amazing, okay, let's come back up to the top. Squak.": null, "Aabria: You and Prince Apollo are moving through the hedges walking and": null, "talking.

It emerges from my head, but do not": null, "debase such a beautiful creature.": null, "Apollo:\u00a0I am so sorry.": null, "Squak: As being of me. No, I give all of that credo to Grandfather.": null, "[Emily laughing]": null, "Squak: Yes, thank you.": null, "Apollo: Long may he\u2014yes, yes. We could blast our way through. How do you": null, "want to deal with this?": null, "Lou: I believe in the moment, in the choice for chaos, I think Squak is": null, "now, my goal is to help Prince Apollo get this Crystal Heart.": null, "Lou: So I,": null, "Squak: Prince, however you best believe we could get to the center of": null, "the maze quickest, I will do anything I can to aid you.": null, "Apollo: I think, fighting! I love fighting!": null, "Squak: Sure, fighting is great.": null, "Emily: Is Prince Apollo kind of stupid?": null, "Squak: Yeah, yes, let's hit 'em. How about we\u2014let's smack 'em around.": null, "How about we get physical? [grunts]": null, "Oscar: You hitting on Apollo?": null, "Lou: Maybe.": null, "[playful instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: Prince Apollo absolutely leads with this sort of sun-bright": null, "rapier and attacks the hedge in front of you, triggering it as it sort": null, "of grows out and down, and you've now, between witnessing the previous": null, "one and sort of your new path, you realize the hedge is triggering a": null, "small Shambling Mound any time you fight it, so I'm gonna need you to": null, "Lou: Oh, wow, second initiative.": null, "Brennan: Ooh!": null, "Emily: Yeah!": null, "Lou: Now with hill.": null, "Lou: That's gonna be a cool 19.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, you're gonna go first.": null, "Lou: What a dream. So do I still have my forehead eagle?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, of course.": null, "Lou: Great. So forehead eagle will attack first.": null, "Brennan: I saw them live. They were great.": null, "Omar: Oh, cool.": null, "Oscar: The comeback tour?": null, "Brennan: The comeback tour, incredible.": null, "Lou: Fucking two accordions fucking slaps, bro. That'll only be an 11": null, "for mind eagle to hit.": null, "Aabria: Okay. That's a little low to hit a hedge.": null, "Lou: That's okay, that's okay. Mind eagle is chill. But then I'll cast\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Actually, you know what? No, hold on.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Lou: Oh, oh!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Because...": null, "Lou: I'm sorry.": null, "Aabria: As mind eagle sort of soars out, Prince Apollo turns to you and": null, "says,": null, "Apollo: We've got this.": null, "Aabria: And gives you a little wink and is gonna grant Bardic": null, "Inspiration to you.": null, "[Brennan gasps]": null, "Lou: Wow!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So you can add a d8.": null, "Lou: Okay, great. I like this guy. I picked the right horse, the right": null, "violent horse for this. That'll be only a 3, so that only gets us up to": null, "14.": null, "Aabria: Just misses, I'm sorry.": null, "Lou: [groans] No, it's all good. I say,": null, "Squak: Thank you.": null, "Lou: And then I'm gonna cast Shatter at a 4th level.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Lou: So that'll be a Constitution saving throw from said Shambling": null, "Mound, 18.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, a 9 isn't gonna do it.": null, "Lou: Great, un, deux, trois, quatre...": null, "Omar: Give us that cinq!

Oh, oh, bad! 9.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Oh no!": null, "Lou: 15, 16\u2026 23 points of damage on this area of hedge.": null, "Aabria: You absolutely blow the hedge away, and it even kind of begins": null, "to impact the next layer of hedge down, and you're able to chump damage": null, "on a deeper level.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Got it.": null, "Aabria: And Prince Apollo happily bows to you like,": null, "Apollo: No, but really, after you. 'Cause I'm just kinda cutting it.": null, "You're really the one putting work in here.": null, "Squak: Still incredibly effective.": null, "Lou: And yes, I'll move on, Shatter. Pass over that Shatter damage and": null, "move on to the next hedge.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, and you keep moving forward. And we're gonna resolve": null, "the joining of you in a little bit. But first, Andhera, you've spent": null, "some time casting and meditating.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria: And you summon a steed.": null, "Omar: I do. In character voice I say this, \"I do.\"": null, "Aabria: The hedge is listening attentively.": null, "Omar: [laughs] I cast Find Steed after 10 minutes, and I wanna say a": null, "pool of cave water, pure, clean cave water, starts to sort of bubble up": null, "from the ground.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Delicious tea.": null, "Omar: Delicious.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Do you drink it?": null, "Omar: I just wanna lick the walls. No, no, no, no, this is my horse.": null, "[laughs] I\u2026 I shouldn't.": null, "Lou: This is my horse.": null, "Emily: You can lick your horse.": null, "Omar: I cross one line, who knows what's next?": null, "[echoing tones resound]": null, "Omar: And it starts to take the form of legs and then a body. And it's": null, "this horse, but as it's about to finish, this sort of dark murkiness": null, "starts to cloud up from the bottom and fills out the shape of the horse,": null, "and it becomes this Nightmare.": null, "Aabria: Ooh, I love a Nightmare.": null, "Omar: And I smile and I turn and I pet the horse's mane and I go,": null, "Andhera: Mucky, my trusted Nightmare, Mucky!": null, "Aabria: And Mucky kind of nuzzles into your hand and gives you a little": null, "headbutt. And even as their tail flickers, you see it's catching the": null, "edges of the hedge aflame as you go.": null, "Andhera: Oh, I've missed you so much. Oh careful, this is actually our": null, "friend. Don't light it on fire if that\u2019s\u2014if you could.": null, "Aabria: And starts reaching forward trying to eat it.": null, "Andhera: Oh no, actually, no. I don't know what that would do. Wait, no,": null, "I can get you... There's like, salad and stuff out there. I can get you": null, "so much food.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. [laughs] And kind of sits back.": null, "Andhera: Okay, hedge, you gave me a sense of my sister and how much she": null, "wants to find the Crystal Heart. Could you lead me to her? It's what I": null, "want.": null, "Aabria: Is that true?": null, "Omar: Yes, it is. In this moment, I want to find my sister.": null, "Aabria: Give me a Persuasion check.": null, "Omar: Persuasion?": null, "Omar: 12.": null, "Aabria: With that, even as your Nightmare kind of wickers, you feel a": null, "little breeze across you in the direction that would send you left. And": null, "you feel that guidance, but also a sense of urgency behind it as the": null, "wind picks up, that you spent a lot of time summoning this horse.": null, "Omar:\u00a0I did, yes.": null, "Andhera: Mucky\u2014": null, "Aabria: And you're behind, but it's not impossible.": null, "Omar: Okay, great. Well, luckily Lady Chirp gave me this potion.": null, "Aabria: Oh, I forgot. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.": null, "Omar:\u00a0So I uncork that.": null, "Aabria: Good, and I'm having a calm reaction. Got it.": null, "[Omar laughs]": null, "Chirp:\u00a0[laughs] I should have made a bet on this.": null, "Aabria: There's people outside. They're like,": null, "Spectators: We're betting on this.": null, "Chirp: I'll get in on it.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. [laughs]": null, "Andhera: Mucky, here you go.": null, "Omar: And I pour the potion into Mucky's mouth and sort of the yellow, I": null, "would suppose, disappears\u2014like, mixes in with the black.": null, "Aabria: This is technically a clear potion, 'cause it's the potion of": null, "Haste.": null, "Omar: Oh, in that case, that's right. The clear does nothing.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Okay, your Nightmare is now under the effect of the": null, "Haste spell.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Aabria: So speed is doubled, +2 bonus to AC, advantage on dex saves, and": null, "an additional action on each of its turns.": null, "Omar: This is a child and their horse. We grew up together. We just": null, "understand each other and communicate without speaking, and just hop on": null, "top of Mucky, and just lean in and whisper,": null, "Andhera: Let's go find them.": null, "Aabria: You gotta tell me what the speed on this horse is now.": null, "Omar: That's right! Yes, that's correct.": null, "Brennan: Unseelie prince on a fiery-hoofed horse charging through a": null, "hedge maze, that's hot.": null, "Aabria: Yes!": null, "Brennan: That's hot, that's hot.": null, "Aabria: Very hot of you.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Quite hot.": null, "Oscar: Yeah, the robe opened.": null, "Oscar: So open chest.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooh, yeah, yeah.": null, "Surena: And suddenly wind is\u2014": null, "Brennan: Chest, rain cloud following behind.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yeah, rain cloud.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Brennan: Does the rain cloud have to orient slightly in front with the": null, "wind so it's gotta get a little bit\u2014": null, "Lou: Well, 'cause it's gotta fall on the face like, you know.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, yeah.": null, "Brennan: Yeah. It's like, okay, we gotta get, we gotta sort of\u2014 \u201cDon't": null, "fire where the plane is, fire where it's gonna be\u201d kinda thing. Yeah,": null, "exactly.": null, "Omar: And I was thinking, you know, actually, as I leap on to this horse": null, "that is made of, that sort of forms and transforms out of cave water,": null, "the elemental shard on the back of my neck glows blue, and there is a": null, "rainstorm, but it's not angry and tumultuous. It's like a healthy spring": null, "rain. And it just sort of, as it rains the water just gets absorbed into": null, "my steed.": null, "[sounds of light rain and water bubbling]": null, "Omar: As we gallop. This is a 90-foot speed.": null, "Aabria: Normally?": null, "Omar:\u00a0Normally.": null, "Aabria: [whispering]\u00a0Oh no.": null, "Omar: Horse.": null, "Aabria: Uh-huh, so that would get doubled to 180. So if you used just": null, "your movement, that's 180 per round, but if the horse used its action": null, "that would jump up to 360.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Yeah. Right.": null, "Aabria: But you also get an extra action if you used a dash.": null, "Aabria: I can't do that math.": null, "Aabria: I can. It's so high.": null, "Aabria: Cool, so with 540\u2026": null, "Aabria: Is that right, 540?": null, "Brennan: Yeah, Haste doubles and gives you an extra action.": null, "Brennan: So that's three actions a turn moving 180. It's 180 times 3": null, "which is\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, 'cause 90 times 6 is 540.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, 540.": null, "Oscar: That's as fast as five ostriches.": null, "Aabria: This thing is ostrich fast.": null, "Omar: All pulling each other.": null, "[energetic instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: I think as you take off as a flash, we get that side-by-side of": null, "you taking off at an ungodly speed even as your sister is slowed by that": null, "sniper shot through the hedge. And it's very apparent that the hedge": null, "can't keep up with how fast you're moving.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria: So eventually... Mocky?": null, "Omar: Mucky.": null, "Aabria: Doesn't have the turn radius.": null, "Omar: Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: And just starts blowing through the hedge. So as you're going, I": null, "need you to make\u2014": null, "Oscar: That's hot.": null, "Brennan: Hot.": null, "Surena: Hot, still hot.": null, "Aabria: Give me four Dexterity saves with advantage as the hedge, even": null, "though it's friendly, has its orders to not allow being pushed through": null, "without remark.": null, "Emily: [in Chirp\u2019s voice] If only we didn't know Pillar Boy when he was": null, "a boy. Oh!": null, "Lou: [in Squak\u2019s voice] If only I was untethered to the sight of him": null, "hiding behind a pillar.": null, "Omar: This is four with advantage?": null, "Omar: Oh\u2026 okay.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna let you know, if you ever roll below an 18.": null, "Omar: Okay, can I borrow a d20?": null, "Brennan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you gotta roll them two at a time, so": null, "that you know which is the lower roll.": null, "Omar: Yes, you're right. Okay, no, this makes... Okay, here we go. Okay.": null, "That's a 7. Oh wait\u2014": null, "Brennan:\u00a0With advantage.": null, "Aabria: With advantage.": null, "Omar: I rolled both of them. One was a 4, one was a 7.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Dang, okay.": null, "Brennan: And then you add your dex.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, okay.": null, "Omar: Which is gonna be, it brings it up to a 9.": null, "Brennan: Do you add your paladin bonus to that or no?": null, "Emily: Yeah, you get saves.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh yeah.": null, "Omar: Oh yeah, you're right.": null, "Brennan: I don't know if you'll make 18, but...": null, "Aabria: Yeah. Oh no, 18 is the hit points. Hold on. [singing] I can do": null, "this.\u00a0": null, "Brennan: 9, AC\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's a 14.": null, "Omar:\u00a014?": null, "Aabria: It's a 14 to beat it.": null, "Brennan: What's your Charisma modifier?": null, "Lou:\u00a0He might make a 14. We're gonna\u2014": null, "Brennan: Is that a +5?": null, "Aabria:\u00a014.": null, "Brennan: Or is that +2?": null, "Omar: +2.": null, "Brennan: Okay, so that's only gonna get you to 11.": null, "Emily: Only +2?": null, "Omar:\u00a011.": null, "Aabria: If you have Inspiration, I'd recommend you burn it now.": null, "Omar: I don't know if I do.": null, "Emily: Ooh, you can also, can't you burn your items?": null, "Aabria: You could also burn an item.": null, "Omar: Oh, I can burn an item?": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh shit, oh shit.": null, "Oscar: But do you want to?": null, "Lou: Which one are you gonna give away?": null, "Omar: Oh, this trumpet.": null, "Oscar: You love the trumpet!": null, "Lou: Didn't you make a whole speech like four episodes ago how you'd": null, "never give your trumpet away?": null, "Omar: Let me explain why I'm burning this.": null, "Omar: If I burn this, does it automatically just like, this whole roll\u2019s": null, "that would go for like an hour\u2014": null, "Aabria: Depends on how good your explanation is.": null, "Omar: If you all recall in episode \"when I got this\u2014\"": null, "Lou: Yeah, if we can just bleep out what he said and just fill it with\u2014": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Omar: Episode \"five\", uh...": null, "Oscar: That's this episode.": null, "Surena: It's this episode.": null, "Lou: We'll take it out. We can take it out.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That\u2019s still wrong.": null, "Surena: Back to one, back to one.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, got it!": null, "Omar: In episode \"one\"...": null, "Aabria: The best part is it's episode two.": null, "Omar: Who's to say?": null, "Aabria: Who can say, who can say?": null, "Omar: I took this and held it because it reminded me of the times that I": null, "used to make mouth sounds deep in the caves and I would just get yelled": null, "at by everybody to be quiet. And the idea of catching up to my sister": null, "and proving myself in this moment, my strategy and my presence taking up": null, "that space.": null, "Omar: I would like to burn this if will catch me up to her.": null, "Aabria: There's something important about what this token represents.": null, "Aabria: It is a moment of triumph. It's also a bond with Lady": null, "Featherfowl of the Lords of the Wing, and her extending a moment out to": null, "you.": null, "Omar: Yes.": null, "Aabria: So if you burn it and make it just a little bit harder to": null, "reforge that connection again, I will happily allow you not just to": null, "catch your sister, but we'll get a shot of you jumping over a hedge and": null, "surpassing her as she is slowed on the ground.": null, "Omar: Interesting, if I promise to\u2014": null, "[Aabria chortles] [Omar laughs]": null, "Omar: Put my character's foot in their mouth the next time I see Lady": null, "Featherfowl with the most horrendous pick-up line that I had to look up": null, "on the internet earlier this morning, can I land next to my sister and": null, "not pass?": null, "Aabria: You could just have that.": null, "Aabria: You don't have to do anything, but you are gonna burn it.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Here it is, yes.": null, "Aabria: That's it, amazing.": null, "[players cheering]": null, "Aabria: So go ahead, narrative control moves to you. What happens?": null, "Omar: We just blast through the leaves. It's unfamiliar terrain, 'cause": null, "we don't have a lot of this type of greenery down in the caves. And my": null, "steed Mucky just is done with it and just barrels through. And we hit a": null, "curve and kind of like, Akira slide past my sister.": null, "Oscar: Ooh, baby.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, yes.": null, "Omar: Park.": null, "[horse whinnies]": null, "Omar: And I\u2014": null, "Lou: Park.": null, "Emily: Parallel parking with other steeds.": null, "Omar: Some steam comes off and kind of like, goes to the next pass": null, "through the wall, and whoever's on the other side will just be confused": null, "by that.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, absolutely.": null, "Omar: And I just kind of look down at them. And I notice their movement,": null, "'cause they're still running, right?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, she is doing her best to keep moving, but she looks over": null, "at you.": null, "Suntar: What are you doing?": null, "[soft harp music]": null, "Andhera: I got a sense that you were here trying your fastest to get to": null, "the Crystal Heart so I thought something.": null, "Suntar: Go on.": null, "Andhera: And now I see that you're actually\u2014you've been afflicted by": null, "what I can only assume was a very callously tossed spell your way.": null, "Suntar: Right, and if I am?": null, "Andhera: You are by far the most capable of our family. You are sort of": null, "the crown jewel. Here.": null, "Omar: And I actually climb off of Mucky.": null, "Andhera: Since you're slowed down, this actually doesn't seem right. Go": null, "ahead, get on the steed. You might be slow, but this steed is fast.": null, "Suntar: What are you doing? Is this a trick?": null, "Andhera: It's not a trick, Sister. Just, if we get it, our family, our": null, "court looks good. It just makes sense. I have\u2014": null, "Suntar: Why not you?": null, "Andhera: Let's be quite honest. It's very difficult for me to look good": null, "in front of Mom. And if she finds out that I assisted you with your": null, "successful retrieval of the Crystal Heart and brought honor to our": null, "family, that makes both of us look good, and that just makes sense.": null, "Aabria: And she moves over to the Nightmare and puts her hand on its": null, "reins.": null, "Suntar: Why do you trust me to tell the truth of what happened in here?": null, "Suntar: I am my mother's daughter.": null, "Andhera: That's a good point. [laughs] One that I had not quite": null, "considered. Let me just say this. The insurance that you would have to": null, "lie about your successes might be a feather in my cap enough.": null, "Aabria: Make a Persuasion check for me.": null, "Omar: Okay. Persuasion? This is going to come out to 16.": null, "Aabria: Okay. [die taps table] And she looks at you, and you can't tell": null, "if this is a moment that's sort of dragging out infinitely because she": null, "is slowed or because she is thinking through every permutation of how": null, "you might be trying to fuck her over with this. But she holds for a long": null, "moment and then eventually saddles up.": null, "Omar: Great.": null, "Aabria: On the horse. And even as she rears it around and turns, the": null, "hedge just past you in the direction you were moving drops down and": null, "away.": null, "[adventurous instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: And you see 100 feet in front of you the Crystal Heart is just": null, "laying on the ground. And in different directions, all of you, excepting": null, "Lady Featherfowl, have moved through the center of the maze. Like, you": null, "were standing with your sister and the Nightmare, and across you see": null, "Prince Apollo and Squak. And you see a contingent of goblins all sort of": null, "surrounding and covering Captain Hob. And you see both Rue and Gwyn": null, "taking their leisure walking through. They're the only ones that don't": null, "look like they've had a hard day with this.": null, "Omar: As I see this, and we now have this steed with an unbelievable": null, "amount of speed, I turn to my sister and I smile in this moment that we": null, "are both united in this goal and have the absolute advantage. And I say,": null, "Andhera: Dear sister, get fucked!": null, "Omar: And I click [snaps fingers] and I want Mucky to just run in the": null, "opposite direction.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh!": null, "[Brennan laughing exuberantly] [Brennan clapping]": null, "Aabria: Oh my God.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh my God!": null, "Brennan: Yeah!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's unreal.": null, "Surena: Oh my God! [laughs]": null, "Aabria: She doesn't have the ability to react in this moment and she": null, "just angrily sails in the other direction. Your sister is gone, removed": null, "from the running.": null, "Omar: And I start to wander and I just put a hand out to the leaves and": null, "I go,": null, "Andhera: I trust your judgment of it's not a matter of who can get there": null, "the fastest, it's who deserves it the most. So let's see how this goes.": null, "Aabria: And the hedges move out and away, and you're all on a large": null, "blank field. That was dope. What do we do about it?": null, "Brennan: Wow, that's so fucking good.": null, "Surena: That's so good.": null, "Oscar: Inspiration!": null, "Aabria hands Omar a glass knight chess piece.": null, "All:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Brennan: Perfect, perfect.": null, "Surena:\u00a0What?": null, "Emily: Nice!": null, "Surena: Oh, magic.": null, "Oscar: You lost an item but you gained another one.": null, "Emily: Wow! Lose money to make money.": null, "Aabria: So here's the problem is we've got four groups at cross": null, "purposes, and I'm not the one that decides who wins, so I need all of": null, "you to roll initiative one more time. [to Surena and Oscar] Yours is a": null, "joint initiative. You're each going to roll and then whoever gets the": null, "higher one is the initiative roll between the two of you.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna pull out the new moon here. See how we do.": null, "Oscar: Yeah, baby.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah!": null, "[players applauding]": null, "Brennan: On the new moon. How about it? Wow.": null, "Omar: 4.": null, "Aabria: Oh no! [laughs] All right, you represent\u2014": null, "Lou: 18.": null, "Aabria:\u00a018.": null, "Oscar: 8.": null, "Surena: 13.": null, "Aabria: Okay, so a 13 for the two of you. All right, with that, Captain": null, "Hob goes first. You see everyone.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Incredible.": null, "Oscar: Gosh.": null, "Brennan: So...": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Oh my God!": null, "Brennan: Here is how the potions would have been distributed in our": null, "[intense instrumental music]": null, "Brennan: The sack, long since dropped behind us once the potions were": null, "removed from it by our goblin corporals. On my right shoulder are": null, "Corporal Blash and Corporal Strump. Corporal Blash has taken the Plant": null, "Affinity potion, and Corporal Strump... I don't think any of this is": null, "gonna matter now, but this is how we\u2014just for backstory.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, I love this. Go ahead, buddy.": null, "Brennan: For backstory, Corporal Strump is giving me the help action on": null, "an upcoming athletics check I would like to make.": null, "Brennan: Corporal Blash took Plant Affinity to be giving us live intel": null, "from the hedges as we made our way through the maze. Left-tenant": null, "Gorebladder, my right hand.": null, "Aabria: Gorebladder!": null, "Brennan: Gorebladder!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I love him!": null, "Oscar: Left-tenant Gallbladder, your right-hand man.": null, "Brennan: My\u2014yes, exactly. Had taken a Detect Thoughts in case there were": null, "any disguised or invisible assailants, so that we would have a live": null, "report of any other mental presences.": null, "Aabria: Incredible.": null, "Brennan: Now, the last two potions that were taken were a Speed potion": null, "and an advantage on Performance. Hob took the Speed potion to make his": null, "way through the maze as fast as possible.": null, "Brennan: The Viscountess Grabalba took the advantage on Performance,": null, "because she's no longer on my cushion.": null, "Captain Hob: With your permission, My Lady, I would like to hurl you at": null, "the Crystal Heart as soon as we are in view of it.": null, "Grabalba: Okay.": null, "Brennan: So coming into view of the Crystal Heart, taking the help": null, "action on an Athletics check from Corporal Strump...": null, "Aabria: [chuckles] Yeah.": null, "Brennan: I\u2014laces up, perfect spiral. I have the Viscountess Grabalba who": null, "has the advantage on Performance check and I would like to, the moment": null, "we see it, hurl her directly at the Crystal Heart.": null, "Aabria: All right, you are hucking nobility. We gotta have a roll about": null, "this. Give me an Athletics check.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0[sighs] Okay.": null, "Aabria: This is wild.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Well, you do have advantage, right?": null, "Oscar: You do.": null, "Brennan: I do have advantage. I do have advantage on this. Okay, come": null, "on, Your Majesty. Let's do the thing. Hold on. This is where it all...": null, "[gasps]": null, "Oscar: Oh!": null, "Surena: Oh!": null, "Brennan: We're gonna take 15 plus 10 is 25.": null, "Aabria: Damn, that'll do it.": null, "[Brennan laughs]": null, "Aabria: She is soaring through the air in the direction of...

That's so funny.": null, "Brennan: Okay... [dice rattling] At the very least, she'll be closer to": null, "it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, 100%.": null, "Brennan: I think that was the thing the whole time is that Hob was here": null, "to set up Grabalba for the big win, right?": null, "Brennan: And then he'll try to close the distance if he can.": null, "Brennan: You know, I have the Haste on.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you're the fastest mover on the field right now.": null, "Brennan: 37.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Yeah, she's 37 feet closer to this. The rest of you": null, "sailing through the air like, [screams] Having a great time. Just keep": null, "in mind that if you guys have anything to interrupt actions or use": null, "reactions, now's the time. She's closer and sailing through the air.": null, "Brennan: So I'll throw her 37 feet. I have... Speed is doubled with": null, "Haste, right?": null, "Brennan: So I currently am moving\u2014I'm moving 120, so I throw her 37": null, "feet, [laughing] immediately scoop her up again. I'm like,": null, "Captain Hob: All right, a little farther next time.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to\u2014I'll hustle. I can move 120 feet.": null, "Brennan: Does that, like, is there\u2014I'm trying to think how to... Can I": null, "scoop her up and then... But I wanna let other people roll and have": null, "their turns, too.": null, "Aabria: Yes. Oh, I'm gonna take this from you in a second.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Cool.": null, "Aabria: As Prince Apollo absolutely catches you. Like, you throw and": null, "then he sees the way you're moving and he goes,": null, "Apollo: Absolutely not, Dispel Magic.": null, "All:\u00a0[gasps] Oh!": null, "Brennan: So I'll...": null, "Emily: Oh!": null, "Brennan: So Dispel Magic, oh shit. So I only move 30.": null, "Brennan: Cool, okay, copy that.": null, "Aabria: So you were able to catch up with her. Once he saw that speed he": null, "was like, \"Oh, absolutely not. We were playing games with that tea": null, "earlier. Go fuck yourself.\"": null, "Brennan: Cool, um...": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Goodbye.": null, "Brennan: So in that case, I have 10-foot reach, so I'll move that 30 and": null, "snatch her up off the ground again.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. Love it.\u00a0And you're still going. And next up, that was": null, "Apollo's action, but it goes to you. Lord Airavis, what are you doing in": null, "this moment?": null, "Lou: Creating a ruckus. I'm going to look to Hob. [chuckles]": null, "Oscar: Oh my God.": null, "Lou: And shout,": null, "Squak: Prince Apollo! Quick, the brave and tremendous Hob is making his": null, "way for the crystal!": null, "Lou: I'm gonna give you Bardic Inspiration.": null, "[Brennan cheers]": null, "Oscar: What?": null, "Lou: And then yell,": null, "Squak: We must stop them! It would be unfitting for you to lose to your": null, "ex-fiance! I mean...": null, "Brennan: What?": null, "[cast shouting]": null, "Lou: And I'm gonna cast Hypnotic Pattern on the group of goblins, so": null, "within kind of a 30-feet cube, kind of I guess in front of them so that,": null, "yeah, I guess you said 37. I don't know how far.": null, "Aabria: Doesn't matter.": null, "Lou: Great, within a 30-feet cube all of the goblins are going to need": null, "to make a Wisdom saving throw.": null, "Aabria: Would you like to roll on behalf of the gobbos?": null, "Brennan: Sure. How many rolls should I make? Just one roll for the whole": null, "group or should I roll for... There's four of us that are active right": null, "now.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, give me your roll and then two rolls for the goblins.": null, "Lou: DC is 18.": null, "Oscar: Oof.": null, "Brennan: DC is 18, okay.": null, "Lou: And remember, you have Bardic.": null, "Brennan: I have Bardic. [snaps fingers] We make it without the Bardic. I": null, "add a +1 to this and I rolled a 17 on the die.": null, "Aabria: Okay, so you're fine.": null, "Brennan: I'm okay.": null, "Aabria: Second one is for Grabalba.": null, "Brennan: This is for Grabalba. What does she add to her Wisdom save?": null, "Aabria: +2.": null, "Brennan: +2? She does not make it.": null, "Aabria: Okay, goblins are a -2 'cause they're little guys.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I get it.": null, "Aabria: They're little guys.": null, "Brennan: Gorebladder... What the hell did I call these guys?": null, "Brennan: Gorebladder, Blash, and Strump.": null, "Surena: Yep.": null, "Brennan: Gorebladder, down for the count. Blash, Blash gets a -2, so": null, "fails.": null, "Brennan: I mean, Strump needs a 20. That's it.": null, "Brennan: Strump...": null, "Lou: Get it, Strump.": null, "Surena: Strump, Strump!": null, "Brennan: That was almost a 19, which wouldn't even have mattered!": null, "Brennan: All my goblins are done. I'm like,": null, "Captain Hob: [sighs] At times it is hard to work with this court!": null, "Aabria: Incredible. Yeah, and for what it's worth, yes, Hypnotic Pattern": null, "does have the range for that. I just didn't want to talk about exactly": null, "how far away it is, 'cause then we'll start drawing triangles.": null, "Oscar: So Hypnotic Pattern puts them to sleep, or?": null, "Lou: No, they are all incapacitated and have a speed of zero.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, for what it's worth, you are holding Viscountess Grabalba,": null, "so she is kind of slumped in your arms, but you can still run with her": null, "if it's important for you to make her touch it first.": null, "Brennan: I literally go from getting ready to chuck her again to like,": null, "grabbing her little hands in my giant ones and being like,": null, "Captain Hob: Okay, we're gonna grab the heart.": null, "Brennan: And like\u2026": null, "Oscar: You're running and doing this.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, like putting a kid on your shoes at a wedding. Like, all": null, "right, we're gonna get it.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. And even as you yelled that accidental bit of": null, "information, you can hear even from here the [gasps] gasp as we do a": null, "little smash cut away to people who are Scrying and watching this final": null, "showdown outside.": null, "Chirp: Expertly done.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Lady Featherfowl...": null, "Oscar: Oh my God. Messy.": null, "Aabria: You are\u2014is it safe to assume that in this moment we find you": null, "running the gambling?": null, "Emily: Yes, absolutely, yeah. I think I'm not betting myself.": null, "Emily: And I'm just like, running the numbers on the probability of": null, "everyone to win and taking lots of\u2014just lots of cash is coming in and": null, "out of my hands.": null, "Aabria: Amazing.

I'm gonna offer you, though, this is a special time.": null, "You are circled around with a lot of the Archfey that either moved into": null, "the maze and got shunted out early, or never went in to begin with and": null, "either already have their laurels and don't need to seek glory or are": null, "just too turnt to try to wander through a hedge maze. You have a captive": null, "audience.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Okay, then this is\u2014": null, "Aabria: You have a bonus rumor phase.": null, "Emily: Okay, great.": null, "Emily: I think as we broadcast this ex-fiance thing, I just immediately": null, "am like,": null, "Chirp: Wow! So perhaps Princess Grabalba showing up on the arm of two": null, "young gentlemen really must have rankled our dear Prince Apollo.": null, "Chirp: Am I alone in this curiosity?": null, "Aabria: Absolutely not. And you see more than any of the others, the": null, "sort of head gossipy tier from the Court of Seafoam inclusive of": null, "Ephendra and Baroness Alven are leaning in and\u2014": null, "Chirp: 'Cause he did seem off, right?": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0": null, "Ephendra:\u00a0No, he was like\u2014": null, "Chirp: Prince Apollo seemed off.": null, "Ephendra: He was so weird.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Ephendra: It was like, too big of an energy.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Ephendra: Like you're compensating.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Absolutely.": null, "Ephendra: It's a lot.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, it must be weighing heavily on him.": null, "Ephendra: That's amazing, and this is such a good insight and I would": null, "never ever spread... I have to go to the bathroom. [laughs]": null, "Aabria: Get up, and you are watching this rumor immediately get deployed": null, "in 100 directions.": null, "Emily: Finally, I found my purpose.": null, "Aabria: And we [slaps hands] cut back to inside. Anything else you wanna": null, "do? That was a good round.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Lou: That's action, bonus action. And I'll hold on to my reaction.": null, "Aabria: Love it. Then that brings us to Rue and\u2026 BINX.": null, "Surena: BINX!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0BINX.": null, "Surena: BINX.": null, "Brennan: And we don't recognize BINX, right?": null, "Surena: Right, 'cause I don't think I changed back.": null, "Aabria: Oh, so Rue and a moth-like stranger have rocked up to the": null, "Aabria: That's an important detail.": null, "Oscar: Yeah, wait. You didn't put your glamor up.": null, "Surena: Well, 'cause we were walking through the thing.": null, "Oscar: Right.": null, "Surena: And so I mean, I guess if I would've seen everybody I would've": null, "been, [gasps] but...": null, "Aabria: The hedges were suddenly dropped.": null, "Surena: Yeah, so I feel like it was just like, time for action, right?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, oh my God.": null, "Surena: So it's almost like in slow motion, I feel, in BINX's mind as": null, "she's now running with Rue towards the crystal, I think that she\u2014there's": null, "like the flickering of... She looks at Apollo, and there's the": null, "flickering of Gwyndolin kind of popping back, but it's suppressed. And": null, "she's kind of figuring out, like what Rue said, \u201cIt's up to me to decide": null, "when and who I am revealing myself to.\u201d And she thinks about the thing": null, "with Gwyndolin, the pact that they made, but she also thinks about the": null, "Court of Craft and how she's the only one left. And how if she were to": null, "stand up and be herself, that would be almost like a warning shot to the": null, "Court of Wonder.": null, "Surena: So in that, seeing that, those thoughts are racing through their": null, "mind as they're running. She casts Fog Cloud to obscure it from": null, "everyone.": null, "Lou: Counterspell.": null, "Lou: Counterspell!": null, "Surena: Shit!": null, "Lou: Nothing will go unseen in this moment.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Incredible.": null, "Surena: Fuck!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So yeah\u2014": null, "Surena: Right.": null, "Brennan: Does anyone else have Counterspell to counter that first": null, "Counterspell?": null, "Surena:\u00a0I don't have Counterspell!": null, "Aabria: Can anyone Counterspell the Counterspell?": null, "Surena: I don't. Oh, God.": null, "Oscar: Can I do a thing?": null, "Aabria: Do you have Counterspell prepared as a spell?": null, "Lou: I mean, you would have to have taken it as a magical secret.": null, "Surena: Wait, wait, you don't have to roll for Counterspell. You just": null, "say it.": null, "Lou: I just say it.": null, "Emily: Especially Fog Cloud, I think, is 1st level, right?": null, "Surena: Yeah. I have Lucky, though. So I was like, can I reroll off it?": null, "No.": null, "Lou: No, you may not.": null, "Surena: I cannot, I may not.": null, "Emily: [laughs] And that is when Lou Wilson turned heel.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0We love it.": null, "Surena: Damn, it's so good.": null, "Brennan: A little bit, wait, is this our first like, true moment of PvP?": null, "[gasps excitedly]": null, "Aabria: Did we get there in the game with flowers and fucking? Yes.": null, "[Brennan laughing]": null, "Emily: There has been very little fucking.": null, "Lou: Okay...": null, "Aabria: Thank you, by the way. Hero shit.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0We're holding it down over here.": null, "Lou: And there'll be a lot more.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, if we could have it.": null, "Brennan: [laughs] Don't do that with a bottle! No!": null, "Emily:\u00a0Oh no.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0No!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh no!": null, "Surena: Bad touch, bad touch.": null, "Omar: That was our shared bottle, Lou.": null, "Emily: Okay, let's\u2014": null, "Surena: That bottle, we always use that.": null, "Brennan: Oh my God.": null, "Lou: Hey, it's all yours, buddy. I got my fill.": null, "Aabria: It looks like you do not have Counterspell prepared.": null, "Oscar: And Counterspell just gets rid of all...": null, "Aabria: It gets rid of this specific spell effect that's being called": null, "in, so as you run forward. What does it look like when BINX casts magic?": null, "Surena: Oh, it is like\u2014when Gwyndolin casts magic it's very like cotton": null, "candy and like, very sparkly. When BINX casts magic, it's very dull and": null, "gray. And it's almost like cigarette smoke.": null, "Surena: Is what the Fog Cloud looks like. It's dusty and gray and": null, "there's soot in it.": null, "Emily: When I see my cousin pull that move...": null, "Emily: Can I enter initiative?": null, "Oscar: Oh my gosh.": null, "Surena: Oh shit, oh shit.": null, "Emily: I loved that. [laughs]": null, "Lou: As that Fog Cloud is cast, a peregrine falcon shoots out of the tip": null, "of my hands and just picks it up and flies away.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, you literally see\u2014": null, "Emily:\u00a0I love it.": null, "Aabria: This creeping cloud, and the falcon grabs the heart of it and": null, "swoops up and away, and you see as it bites down, all of it dissipates": null, "immediately.": null, "Surena: The fog and the...": null, "Aabria: The bird is gone. The necklace is still there.": null, "Surena: Got it, so that was how the Counterspell-": null, "Lou: That's what it looks like.": null, "Surena: Yes, that's what it looks like. Great.": null, "Aabria: Roll initiative for me.": null, "Aabria: Get in here.": null, "Emily: 10.": null, "Aabria: Okay. You would technically enter initiative just before": null, "Andhera.": null, "Omar: Oh!": null, "Emily: Yeah, oh my gosh.": null, "Aabria: But before that, you guys are still up.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria: So a Fog Cloud was attempted.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: It was Counterspelled.": null, "Surena: How far is it from us? Can we sprint?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0100 feet, baby.": null, "Surena: Okay, um...": null, "Aabria: [singing]\u00a0Not in one round. Unless you have stuff to make you": null, "move faster.": null, "Surena:\u00a0I don't.": null, "Aabria: Or teleport.": null, "Surena: So I want to, uh, oh... No, that\u2019s\u2014I can't do that 'cause that's": null, "a spell and I've already used a spell. Why didn't I use that other": null, "spell? It's fine. [laughs] It's all I have. I just\u2014I'm gonna keep": null, "running. 'Cause I have Mage Hand and I was like, that's, no.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, okay. So you are sprinting in.": null, "Surena: Yeah, I'm just... [pants]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Rue, what are you doing?": null, "Oscar: I wanna use Misty Step just to get a little closer.": null, "Aabria: Love that. You pop 30 feet closer and continue to move.": null, "Oscar: Yes, and then I would like to use Pyrotechnics, but specifically": null, "use the smoke magic. So yeah, so I Misty Step, I show up, and then...": null, "[chuckles] I say,": null, "Rue: Okay, it's time.": null, "Oscar: And can I\u2014may I do a Pyrotechnics smoke?": null, "Aabria: Please do.": null, "Oscar: Okay, great. So yeah, so out of my hand shoots a little firework,": null, "right? And I throw it up, and instead of exploding into fireworks it": null, "just like, poof, putters out and all the smoke envelops over the area.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. And I know you're gonna say something at home about": null, "being able to cast two spells. It's Pyrotechnics. It's cool. And it's a": null, "flavor thing, so go fuck yourself.": null, "Aabria: It's fine and I allow it.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Sorry.": null, "Aabria: No, you're good. I said it's fine.": null, "Aabria: So yeah, that smoke begins to settle in and you guys keep": null, "sprinting in.": null, "Brennan: How big is that smoke?": null, "Lou: How big that smoke?": null, "Aabria: How big the smoke is, though?": null, "Oscar: It is a 20-feet radius moving around corners. And it persists for": null, "one minute or until a strong wind disperses it.": null, "Brennan: Incredible.": null, "Lou: Hedge!": null, "Aabria: All right, let's insert you into the initiative.": null, "Emily: Actually, I think I'm not gonna do it because my thing takes 10": null, "minutes to do anyway, so I'm good, yeah.": null, "Emily: Thank you, though.": null, "Aabria: You slowly begin casting a spell. We'll come back to you in 10": null, "minutes.": null, "Omar: Also getting a horse?": null, "Emily: No, I was just gonna fuck with everyone. [laughs]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Everyone gets a horse. Andhera.": null, "Omar: I am taking in everything that's happening.": null, "Omar: And I turn to you two, recognizing Rue and not recognizing BINX.": null, "Surena: Hey.": null, "Omar: And the Counterspell, that all happened in front of us.": null, "Omar: And putting it together, I look in your direction.": null, "Surena: Uh-huh.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Do we make eye contact?": null, "Surena: Yeah, sure.": null, "[pause]": null, "Omar: Just for flavor.": null, "Omar: I'm playing a paladin.": null, "Omar: I can't be charmed, I can't be thrown into falling in love 'cause": null, "of magic.": null, "Aabria: Correct.": null, "Omar: And I can't be put to sleep. That last one, not important. I don't": null, "know why I brought it up.": null, "Surena: I mean\u2026": null, "Omar: I want to say, just because of the nature of that magic, I": null, "recognize your eyes even with the charm turned.": null, "Surena: Mm-hmm, 'cause I think Gwyndolin and BINX have the same eyes.": null, "Surena: Like that's what I made true, so you would for sure.": null, "Omar: So we make eye contact, and I recognize you, and I think about the": null, "magic that you just pulled. And I straighten my posture and I give you a": null, "nod and a smile.": null, "Omar: And I turn and I princely take my 30 feet to move, and I see the": null, "necklace 70 feet away from me, and I cast Darkness.": null, "[Brennan gasps softly]": null, "Omar: Pointing at a spot 60 feet away.": null, "Omar: And if you're counting at home and you're like, \u201coh wait a second,": null, "that's not enough.\u201d It is a 15-foot spell to engulf the necklace. And": null, "then with the free action of speaking, I would just like to turn to the": null, "nearest part of the hedge that is close to me and whisper,": null, "Andhera: Again, I trust your judgment. I don't see why this has to be": null, "fought over. Again, it goes to the person who deserves it the most.": null, "Please proceed, I suppose.": null, "Omar: And I whisper that in that voice and then turn and go, [laughs]": null, "Andhera: Darkness, I've cast it. And I\u2014look at that, damn. [laughs]": null, "Everyone, we all\u2014did we all do\u2014hello...": null, "[Surena chuckles]": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So yeah, you all see. And it's a 15-foot radius, so a": null, "30-foot diameter sphere of darkness that cannot be seen through unless": null, "you have some very specific abilities gets dropped over it, and unless": null, "someone... Here's how we're gonna resolve it, 'cause the hedge doesn't": null, "get to pick. It's on you all, so I need all five of you in here, and": null, "I'll roll on Apollo's behalf.": null, "Aabria: Everyone's going to make an Investigation check. I would say": null, "with disadvantage. It doesn't matter. Everyone just gets one roll, and": null, "whoever gets the highest is the one that finds it.": null, "Oscar: It ain\u2019t me...": null, "Lou: Can I give Apollo the help action rather than roll myself?": null, "Emily: Oh, that's good.": null, "Oscar: I'm all in on Apollo.": null, "Aabria: Absolutely do.": null, "Lou: Great, I'd like to give the help action to Apollo.": null, "Brennan: Can I action surge to give disadvantage to Prince Apollo?": null, "Oscar: Oh, what the heck?": null, "Brennan: And you make it a straight roll?": null, "Aabria: I'll allow it!": null, "[Emily laughs]": null, "Aabria: I'll allow it. Okay.": null, "Oscar: Is there any way I can help...": null, "Brennan: Yeah, wait. Just to understand the moment in time.": null, "Aabria: Well, exactly, if we're action surging, can I give Bardic": null, "Inspiration to counter that?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yeah\u2014": null, "Aabria: All right, now we're doing a whole goddamn thing. I think this": null, "is just\u2014then I'm gonna say no. No other magical effects on top of it.": null, "This is just a group of people groping in the dark.": null, "Aabria: Hoping that they come up with the Crystal Heart. So, no extra": null, "effects. If you find it and you don't want to be the one with it, we'll": null, "then adjudicate how you can try to slip it to your people in the dark.": null, "Lou: Oops.": null, "Oscar: Ew! [laughs]": null, "Brennan: Yeah, I would say, 'cause my question would be, is the": null, "Viscountess Grabalba with that Hypnotic Pattern, is she just gone, she's": null, "out of it?": null, "Aabria: She's gone, so you would have to find it and then get it in her": null, "hands.": null, "Brennan: So in that case, I think it's more important to Hob to prevent": null, "Apollo from getting it than it is for him to get it himself. Does that": null, "make sense?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Absolutely.": null, "Brennan: He's like, if Grabalba is toast, then this ruins the whole plan": null, "and I need to just make sure Apollo doesn't get it.": null, "Lou: Well, I'm the reverse. So I think we'll both bow out and Apollo": null, "will roll straight.": null, "Brennan: Cool.": null, "Oscar: Wow.": null, "Aabria: All right. Let's get our rolls going. [rolls die] Shit.": null, "Lou: [chuckles] Just the three of us just... [grunts]": null, "Aabria: I'll let you know what you have to beat for Apollo.": null, "Aabria: He's got an 18.": null, "[players chortle]": null, "Brennan: I'm sitting on a Bardic Inspiration that was so kindly given to": null, "me by the Lord Squak.": null, "Aabria: Go ahead, roll it and I'll subtract that from Apollo's result.": null, "[Oscar gasps]": null, "Brennan: 5.": null, "Surena: So I rolled a 9, but I have Lucky and\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Go ahead.": null, "Surena: Great. 'Cause my whole vibe is lost things.": null, "Surena: That's my court.": null, "Aabria: This is your exact stand.": null, "Surena: The court of lost things.\u00a0Fuck! I'm so stressed out!": null, "Aabria: Hold on, hold on, hold on! This is the time to roll in the Box": null, "of Doom!": null, "Brennan: Yes!": null, "[players shouting]": null, "Brennan: Wait, are you\u2014I was gonna ask. Are you searching for it as": null, "well, Rue?": null, "Oscar: I\u2014yes, but I would love to help.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria: There's not really a way to direct someone in the dark, so I'm": null, "gonna have you roll. And if you just win, then we'll talk about how you": null, "found it.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Oh, I see. Okay, gotcha.": null, "Aabria: And then you got it to her.": null, "Oscar: Okay, so that will be my helping, is participating.": null, "Aabria: Yes, 100%. This absolutely has to be a Box of Bloom.": null, "[players cheer]": null, "Emily:\u00a0Yeah!": null, "Aabria presents the Box of Doom, which has a crown of plants on top.": null, "Aabria: Look at this little guy! Look, he's so beautiful.": null, "Brennan: Never looked better.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh my God.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, I'm just gonna hold it like a full crate.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Okay, okay.": null, "Brennan: What do you need to roll? Like what do you add to your": null, "Investigation?": null, "Surena: Oh, I add\u2014": null, "Emily:\u00a0Oh, rogue, so you're probably really good.": null, "Surena: A 1, I have a 1 investigation.": null, "Emily:\u00a0What?": null, "Lou: Come on, Prince Apollo!": null, "Brennan: So what is that? Is that a 12 or higher?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, a 12 or higher.": null, "Emily: She needs to roll a\u00a012 or higher.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Knocks Apollo out of the running.": null, "Lou: Hey, under 50%.": null, "[tense percussive music]": null, "Lou: Come on, Apollo.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You got this, you got this!": null, "Lou: Come on, Apollo!": null, "Surena: Oh please, oh please!": null, "Surena rolls a 15.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What is it?": null, "Surena: It is a 16.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, 17 is now the number to beat. I'm gonna hand that back to": null, "Surena: 16 is the number to beat.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, 16 is the number to beat.": null, "Surena: Yeah, mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Can you hold it for the next person?": null, "Surena: Yes, I will hold it for the next person.": null, "Lou: It is being held.": null, "Oscar: Okay, here we go. I need to beat a 16.": null, "Brennan:\u00a016.": null, "Oscar: But I mean\u2014": null, "Oscar: I'm happy with not beating a 16.": null, "Oscar rolls a 9.": null, "Oscar: A 9.": null, "Emily: Yay!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You're fumbling around in the dark. You cannot find it.": null, "Aabria: I still want you to roll\u2014": null, "Aabria: On Apollo's behalf to see if you can help him out, 'cause he did": null, "a mediocre job.": null, "Lou: Sure, happily.": null, "Oscar: Look into the eyes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Of this little guy.": null, "Lou: Little guy. I will stare deeply into the eyes of little guy.": null, "Lou rolls a 3.": null, "Lou:\u00a0That is only a 7.": null, "Emily: Oh.": null, "Aabria: All right. Can you hold it for Hob?": null, "Omar: I'll hold it for Hob.": null, "Brennan: You'll hold for me? Thank you. So in other words, me and": null, "Airavis are not canceling each other out.": null, "Brennan: Copy that, okay.": null, "Aabria: If you roll the highest, then we can talk about what happens.": null, "Brennan: Copy that. And my Investigation here\u2014": null, "Surena: Ooh, ooh!": null, "Brennan: Is\u2014I only add +1 to this as well, so it's gotta be a 16 or": null, "higher.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So it's gotta be a 16.": null, "[Brennan blows on die]": null, "Brennan rolls a 10.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Not a 16. That's an 11.": null, "Emily: Wow.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Last but not least, Andhera, you walk into the darkness, your": null, "element.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Ooh, yeah.": null, "Lou:\u00a0He's home.": null, "[dramatic music swells]": null, "Omar rolls a nat 20.": null, "Omar:\u00a0That's a crit.": null, "Aabria: Shut up.": null, "Lou: Das crit.": null, "Omar: That was a crit, it's like\u2014": null, "Brennan: That is a crit. That is a nat 20.": null, "[Surena slaps table]": null, "Lou: What?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Um, holy shit. I love when dice tell a story.": null, "Surena: That's incredible!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Thank you.": null, "Omar: Technically a 21, 'cause I have a +1.": null, "Aabria: Okay, calm down. It's a natural 20. You did it.": null, "Surena: Holy shit, holy shit!": null, "Omar: You just said in my element.": null, "Omar: I can't see in darkness.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Correct.": null, "Omar: Because it's Darkness casted.": null, "Omar: But I can hear, and I'm used to listening in darkness.": null, "Omar: I would like to say then.": null, "Omar:\u00a0If it's all right with you.": null, "Aabria: Please.": null, "Omar: I listen for the breeze that the hedge is blowing for a very": null, "particular sound that I'm actually well aware of. Granted, it's a bit": null, "bigger in this instance, but it's a sound I do know. And I would like to": null, "very sneakily push the heart into the hands of one BINX.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[gasps] Amazing.": null, "Aabria: You feel in the dark as you're scrabbling through the grass.": null, "And\u2014 [chuckles] Regency question. Gloves or no gloves?": null, "Surena: Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask.": null, "Aabria: It's the most important thing!": null, "Surena: Yeah, do our hands touch, like?": null, "Surena:\u00a0I just need to understand what's happening here.": null, "Brennan: Please let them touch!": null, "Omar: I will\u2014okay.

I don't make any sound myself.": null, "Omar: To the best of my ability. And no one can see in the darkness, but": null, "were the audience to be privy to this, 100% that Darcy-esque shaking,": null, "tense.": null, "Brennan: Amazing.": null, "Aabria: And you feel grass and then the warmth of a hand. And then": null, "something sharp and cold pressed into it. BINX, you are holding the": null, "Crystal Heart.": null, "Surena: Uh...": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You're in the dark.": null, "Surena: Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: Before you dispel the Darkness, I want to give you a chance to": null, "know, because you're a thing of lost objects and liminal spaces, and": null, "this is that, so please make a Perception check, or Insight with": null, "advantage.": null, "Surena: Okay. [die taps table] Oh God. Uh, okay... That is a\u2014you said": null, "Perception or...": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Or Insight.": null, "Surena: Okay. That is a 19.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Make a Deception check.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Wow!": null, "Omar: That's only a 15.": null, "Emily: Wow!": null, "Emily: I'm the studio audience.": null, "Aabria: Wow!": null, "Brennan: It's so romantic!": null, "Omar: Chair of flowers just\u2026": null, "Aabria: He smells like an oncoming storm and dark water and eroded": null, "stone. You know exactly who pressed this into your hand.": null, "Emily: Wow! Ooh, yeah.": null, "Brennan: Oh, ooh.": null, "Aabria: The hedge, of its own volition, intercedes and drops your": null, "Darkness spell.
