It just is so easy and it's wild because when you play a": null, "family, you have to have that certain dynamic of that love and that": null, "trust and that give and take and the back and forth, and the fact that": null, "we talk over each other in a way that we all sort of can clock and latch": null, "onto is so incredible. I've never had it like that at a table before.": null, "Aabria: You guys hit the ground running and felt so much like this": null, "beautiful lived in family unit from minute one. Just in the opening": null, "vignettes, I was like, [whisper] \"Oh my God, they're so good at this.": null, "They're all so fucking good at this.\"": null, "Brennan: There's a thing that is a temptation, when people play": null, "characters, there's a temptation to take a character and be like,": null, "\u201cwhat's the most interesting facet, what's the thing,\u201d and I'm gonna hit": null, "that and hit that tone every time. And then you do something as": null, "realistic as a family and you realize that every person is multiple": null, "people. The Jaysohn that is Tula's son is a different Jaysohn from the": null, "Jaysohn that is Lila's brother. And that's really how people are like.": null, "And like Viola, for as imposing as she is to the followers of her": null, "husband, is so sweet and loving to her husband. And then so when we": null, "talk, it's immediately conspiratory. I wasn't expecting us to be": null, "mischievous together.": null, "Siobhan: [Siobhan] Yes. I know.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Yeah!": null, "Siobhan: I love Viola also going \"Walmer, no.\" \"What? Absolutely not.\"": null, "Aabria: I'm not caught up and immediately fuck that shit.": null, "Brennan: There's a world where we have an adversarial sister": null, "relationship, and it's so cool. When you were like \"Walmer, no.\" I was": null, "like \"Thank God for my sister.\" No! Terrible.": null, "Rashawn: Terrible.": null, "Brennan: The little moment of having those aged berries and you were": null, "looking at me like ooh, and you immediately caught what I was going for.": null, "Let's get a little fucked up in the morning.": null, "Rashawn: Yeah, let's have some breakfast wine.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, a little mimosa, exactly.": null, "Aabria: Literally wine aunt energy immediately.": null, "Rashawn: Just holding a berry and just scooping it up.": null, "Aabria: \u201cJaysohn, come do that little dance you do.\u201d (everyone laughing)": null, "Rashawn: Yes! You know exactly what kinda auntie I am, yes! Do that": null, "little dance you do. (everyone laughing) I like that.": null, "Erika: Yeah, it's so funny because you can immediately see where": null, "everybody else is with each other. Even if they haven't talked directly": null, "to each other yet. You're like \"I know exactly how this is gonna go\".": null, "Ugh.": null, "Siobhan: It's very cool.": null, "Aabria: You guys are so cool.": null, "Siobhan: And when are we gonna fight?": null, "Brennan: When are we gonna fight?": null, "Jasper: I think I'm good, honestly. After that episode, I think I'm good": null, "not fighting-": null, "Aabria: This is a gentle exploration of family and probably nothing": null, "external to you will be an issue.": null, "Erika: I forgot, it's been a minute since I've been in the dome, and I'm": null, "like, we could have to fight at any minute. And I'm like, no, that's not": null, "how production works.": null, "Brennan: Don't use, I've heard suddenly, \u201cI'll defend Aabria,\u201d and I was": null, "like don't use your above game knowledge of how heavy these sets are. We": null, "could choose to stop down and slap one in anytime.": null, "Aabria: Let me be very clear. The neutral board has battle dots on it.": null, "Erika: [Erika] That's what-": null, "Rashawn: When you said neutral, I was like there's nothing neutral-": null, "Siobhan: Yes, this is very threatening.": null, "Aabria: Good. Stay ready.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] It's extremely threatening. Yeah. Born ready.": null, "Brennan: Is this a terribly boring question to ask? I would-": null, "Siobhan: Yes.\u00a0Next?": null, "Aabria: Oh no! Goddamn!": null, "Brennan: [as Tula, jokingly] Jaysohn!": null, "Aabria: If I had a candy I would, (gasps) I do have candy.": null, "Siobhan: Yes, yes, yes!": null, "Brennan: I was gonna ask if people wanted, 'cause this family is so": null, "great. If people wanted to talk about why they chose to play these": null, "characters, that's a question that I feel fans of the show would wanna": null, "know.": null, "Erika: I feel like Siobahn was the first one to be like, \"I'm gonna be a": null, "karate boy.\"": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you did come out, you were like, \"I'm Jaysohn the karate": null, "boy.\" And everyone went-": null, "Jasper: Okay.": null, "Erika: I'll build something around that.": null, "Aabria: Say fucking less. Everyone knew exactly who that was": null, "immediately.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, I just wanted, I've wanted to play a little jumpy boy for": null, "a while. I actually pitched it for \"Neverafter\" but it just didn't make": null, "sense.": null, "Aabria: Now what's \"Neverafter?\"": null, "Siobhan: Never heard of it.\u00a0It just didn't make sense in the context of": null, "the rest of the party. And then when you pitched this I was like, \"Well,": null, "well, well. If it isn't serendipity, my old friend.\"": null, "Aabria: Ugh, but having Jaysohn come out of the gate and already be": null, "immediately the biggest pain in everyone's ass and the saving grace": null, "within one episode is so fucking cool.": null, "Jasper: It's just fun to be really annoying. (laughs)": null, "Aabria: Fact.": null, "Siobhan: And I just like being a thorn in everybody's side. Thank you so": null, "much. Thank you so much for letting me be as annoying as I wanna be all": null, "the time!": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Hell yes!": null, "Siobhan: Just really letting the ADHD out.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Ooh, feels good.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah.": null, "Jasper: But I kind of felt like it was from there that like, it was": null, "like, oh yeah, family. Do you know what I mean, immediately there was": null, "just this, oh everyone kind of just started latching onto this idea of": null, "family and it kind of fit in with a couple people's other suggestions,": null, "which was pretty awesome.": null, "Brennan: You said that and then it was \"Jaysohn\" as a name came about": null, "very quickly 'cause it's the most shoutable name in the world. [Everyone": null, "immediately shouting \"Jaysohn!\"]\u00a0And then Izzy, you were talking about": null, "the conspiracy, very quickly it was two siblings came into focus.": null, "There's a couple of us that are based off of an homage to pop culture.": null, "Mine is very much, I've modeled my character after Mrs. Brisby from": null, "\"Secret of NIMH\" , and you were like Lisa Simpson which I thought was": null, "awesome as like a-": null, "Izzy: Specifically, when they go to, I think, the water park.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. Yeah.": null, "Erika: [Erika] Yeah.\u00a0The holding the blanket.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, she loses her clothes and her shoes and she's in the blanket": null, "and then she's contracted something and she says, \"I'm the lizard": null, "queen.\"": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yep.": null, "Siobhan: But I also, 'cause you talked about, and the thing that I love": null, "most about, I'm so grateful for the Simpsons writers to have done, is": null, "that Lisa is this smart little know-it-all, but she sits down and": null, "watches Itchy and Scratchy with her brother and she loves it. [Everyone": null, "saying 'Yeah' in agreement]\u00a0Which feels very real and very human.": null, "Erika: And then I think it was cult leader.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, I-": null, "Erika: You were like \"Cult leader?\"": null, "Jasper: I think I pitched reluctant-": null, "Aabria: Great, I'm the family cult leader.": null, "Brennan: Reluctant cult leader is so funny.": null, "Jasper: And it was as soon as I remember Brennan going, \"Yep.\" (everyone": null, "laughing) I was like, okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, I": null, "think it was more 'cause there was you'd given us a bit of a basis like": null, "oh, things to think around and I had a couple of little ideas. But yeah,": null, "I think just as soon as I said a cult leader, a couple people were like,": null, "\"yeah, this is fun, this could be fun.\" And then, yeah kind of just born": null, "outta that. And then for the name and the style of the character and": null, "everything is actually also based in some pop culture. It's my very": null, "first, 'cause I felt like this was kind of a big deal. I'm gonna be on": null, "D20, I wanna bring something cool. So my very first D&D character was": null, "based on my favorite person from a book who's called Lamora, Locke": null, "Lamora, sorry, and he's known as the Thorn of Camorr.": null, "Aabria: Yep.": null, "Jasper: And so, and I kind of basically, my very first character was": null, "based on him and I was like, \u201cooh, wonder if I could do a little riff on": null, "that\u201d 'cause I loved that character but never kind of got to fully play": null, "it to fruition. So I kind of enveloped it a bit in this, and then the": null, "little bit of thing that might come up, might not come up, but he was": null, "never given a name. But he was known, Thorn was known as a, he had like": null, "a bit of a legend around him, of mystique around him, and people": null, "referred to him or other stoats referred to him as the Thorn of the": null, "Vale. And so he was just like, when he realized, oh, other stoats have": null, "names, I should have a name 'cause I don't have one. So he was just": null, "like, I'll go with Thorn Vale.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] I love that.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yeah, that's very cool.": null, "Rashawn: And when I think cult leader, I think powerful woman pulling": null, "the string.": null, "Aabria: Let's go!": null, "Izzy: Who's the lady who, Nancy Salzman?": null, "Rashawn: Yes, from The NXIVM?": null, "Izzy: Yeah.": null, "Rashawn: Yes, she's very much a figure, and I think her name is Sheena-": null, "Siobhan: Sheela": null, "Rashawn: -Sheela from Wild, Wild Country. Fashion down, vicious woman": null, "who's in charge of things. And me, I'm an, the oldest of three and the": null, "only girl. So I'm like, being a younger sister was also something very": null, "interesting, or just having a sister period. So thank you for going on": null, "this journey with me. And just what would it be like to try to establish": null, "a role in the family? I may not be as established as my sister, but yes,": null, "this is a new relationship. But who is Viola, in the sense of family? If": null, "there was no Thorn, but I'm so glad there is a Thorn. Who would she be?": null, "What role does she have? And the name Viola, just 'cause Viola Davis is": null, "my favorite. And I saw her at Target once so-": null, "Izzy: No, she doesn't go to Target!": null, "Rashawn: She shops at Target just like us!": null, "Erika: She's just us, but (indistinct)!": null, "Aabria: Yes!": null, "Izzy: What was she getting?": null, "Rashawn: She was, well-": null, "Siobhan: How long did you follow her?": null, "Rashawn: I was on my way out, I was all masked up and stuff, and then I": null, "heard her. I heard her before I realized like, oh my, wait, was that": null, "Viola Davis? And the, you know, my-. [overlapping chatter] Yes.

So yeah, just like reaching into": null, "some of her iconic things and I read her book recently, which is": null, "incredible and heartbreaking and she's been, so much has happened to": null, "her. By the time she was 12, so much had happened to her. But the way": null, "they pronounce her name phonetically in the book is Vow-la.": null, "All: Vow-la.": null, "Izzy: Like two syllables.": null, "Brennan: Like a slide.": null, "Siobhan: My favorite Viola Davis is how in \"Suicide Squad\" she always": null, "has half a steak in her mouth.

And you're like, \"Someone says something that pisses": null, "me off. Well check it out. I'm gonna pop off!\" And it's very cool to": null, "play a character that's like, \"my mom just really hurt my feelings.\" And": null, "instead of being like, \"Well, we're in a status fight,\" to play a": null, "character that really and truthfully and honestly goes like, \"Great,": null, "you're right mom.
