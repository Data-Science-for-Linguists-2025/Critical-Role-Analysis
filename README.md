# Critical-Role-Analysis
Final project by Ashley Bakaitus. Discourse analysis of D&amp;D podcasts Critical Role and Dimension20

Critical Role transcripts sourced from [Kryogenix](https://www.kryogenix.org/crsearch/html/index.html#c2) and created by CRTranscript, a fan-led transcription service, Critical Role, and compiled by Stuart Langridge.

Description of data columns (preview single episode [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/Critical-Role-Analysis/blob/main/data_samples/CR_ep2.csv), .006% of full dataset):

"index" - line index **per episode** (regular index is for full df of 147 files)<br>
"name" - speaker name<br>
"text" - full text of transcribed speech event<br>
"episode" - which episode associated with line (in preview, this column is only populated with '2')<br>
"timestamp" - timestamp information for start of speech event in HH:MM:SS format<br>
"inaudible_speech" - any speech event partially or entirely tagged as \[inaudible\] (in ep 2 this column is empty)<br>
"nonspeech" - any line of speech partially or entirely consisting of non-speech values (e.g. (laughter), (yells) or sound effects)

Note: in linked preview these columns are easier to discern in the Code tab than in the Preview tab
