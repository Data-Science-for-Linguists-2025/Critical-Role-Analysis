We're": null, "going to find the Blue and use it to fight the monsters.": null, "Thorn: Yes, I guess in some way. [yawns]": null, "Ava: Shh!": null, "Thorn: [whisper] I guess in some way, yes. It was a lot to take in": null, "yesterday. And truth be told, it's hard to know what's the right thing,": null, "but I guess all we can do is continue to move forward so...": null, "Ava: Hm, that is not a bad answer.": null, "Thorn: [looks at his wrist]\u00a0What time is it? This is so early.": null, "Ava: What are you looking at? [Aabria laughing]": null, "Thorn: The light's always on. It feels like it's so early.": null, "Ava: Oh, yeah. Well, I'm going to go and look for Truck.": null, "Thorn: Okay.": null, "Ava: So I need you to keep an eye on things. I know that [sucks air": null, "through teeth] I think my girls are having their hands a little full,": null, "but they're very good.

That was... Mm... [smacks lips thoughtfully, then taps Thorn]": null, "Good. [gentle instrumental music]": null, "Thorn: [exhales deeply] Thank you. It was rather impressive seeing you": null, "in your element as a part of the group just like you were, it's like": null, "you'd always been there.": null, "Ava: I have always been there, yes.": null, "Thorn: Okay, uh, sure. Do you want anyone to come with you to find Truck": null, "or?": null, "Ava: No, I'm going to go look for Truck. I don't think everybody's quite": null, "ready for things, especially, especially Tula.

You'll be fine.": null, "Ava: I will be fine.": null, "Thorn: Of course you will.": null, "Ava: You have made me not regret that you married my daughter.

[Aabria chuckles]": null, "Ava: All right, I'm gonna go on out and suppose I can go... I might just": null, "go take a... I don't wanna bother Sybil. I'm sure she's sleeping.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sure, yeah.": null, "Erika: Right now, but I'm just gonna take a look around for Truck.": null, "Aabria: Okay, on the inside, go ahead and give me an investigation or": null, "perception check.": null, "Erika: Mm.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I wanna make it investigation but-": null, "Erika: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: No one has investigation.": null, "Erika: \u00a0No.": null, "Aabria: Except for people who are like, I know secrets. No one else has": null, "built a build for that.": null, "Erika: Perception to see what I can hear or smell or-": null, "Aabria: Yeah, kinda suss out.": null, "Erika: It's a very distinctive smell, Truck.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It is. You're right.": null, "Erika: Yeah. Oh, nope. Eight.": null, "Aabria: That's okay. You can't find any signs of Truck here. And as you": null, "sort of skitter out moving very quickly, I think there's a moment where": null, "you realize and you link this up to when you were running at full speed": null, "with the herd of stoats that were hunting that when you get to open all": null, "the way up 'cause you're not sort of with children and your children's": null, "children and moving in that, like, we all stay together at this medium": null, "pace, you're like, oh, I can get around here pretty quickly. And because": null, "it's so early, there aren't a lot of stoats flowing around. Maybe 1,000": null, "are moving through central spaces. You do not sense or scent anything to": null, "do with Truck, but you do see towards the walls some of the doors that": null, "are a little higher up, and occasionally on the ground in front of them": null, "sets of striped lines painted into the concrete that at a certain angle": null, "you're like, that's kinda the width of the weird legs of Truck.": null, "Erika: Oh, I see. Maybe that's Truck's writing. Hm.": null, "Aabria: You said the word writing so now I'm gonna make you roll to": null, "learn how to read against your will. You had that thought.": null, "Jasper: Here we go.": null, "Aabria: So now you've gotta make a wisdom saving throw, and if you get": null, "higher than, hold on... A 12, you unfortunately know how to read now.": null, "Erika: I, it seems so pretentious. [cast laughing] 10! I live to be": null, "illiterate another day!": null, "Aabria: You resist understanding with a strength of will that honestly": null, "defies comprehension. Like, I will not let that make sense. No, I will": null, "not. Cool.": null, "Erika: Just kind of glaze over.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Glaze over! [Aabria laughing]": null, "Erika: Ah, ah... All right, but I can... I'm going to follow the yellow": null, "truck read. I'm going to follow the yellow truck read.": null, "Arabia: Truck tracks? Yeah, for sure. [laughs] You truck read the lines": null, "on the ground and make your way through like, again, these sort of like": null, "tunnels that were dug into several foot thick walls of concrete that": null, "were dug into several foot thick walls of concrete and make your way out": null, "again. And you see, yeah, there are whole versions of that like, strange": null, "flat rock that would sort of run of that like, strange flat rock that": null, "would sort of run like a bizarre river close to your house, but it was": null, "always like, patchy with grass and trees growing through it. It's": null, "smooth.": null, "Erika: Hm. Bleh, ugh.": null, "Aabria: Smelling it. Go again... No, no, no, you've already rolled. Kind": null, "of, as you move across this unbroken stone, as you smell it you pick up": null, "just little traces of that weird acrid smell that came from the first": null, "time you saw Truck.": null, "Erika: Hm, you know, scent is probably the most keen sense that I have,": null, "scent is probably the most keen sense that I have, and the one most": null, "likely to bring back memories. And my eyes are going and my hearing's": null, "not always so good. And a lot of things just, yeah, I mean, the": null, "blueberries don't taste like they used to.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Erika: But that may just be because they don't make the blueberries like": null, "they used to. But scent is still, scent is still strong. And oh, it": null, "brings me back to that horrible day. Mm, I'd like to follow Truck.": null, "Aabria: You follow the scent for Truck. Give me a survival check. [die": null, "taps table]": null, "Erika: 13.": null, "Aabria: As you're kind of sniffing out this very faint odor, I think you": null, "look down and realize sort of without it as you are lost in your reverie": null, "and sort of remembering one of the worst days of your life, you don't": null, "realize that you are at a full sprint and you are covering ground around": null, "the outside of Last Bast. You come forward and you realize you are": null, "running very close to where you sort of ended up yesterday, that strange": null, "pen that they made for the spiny elk.": null, "Erika: Oh.": null, "Aabria: And the smell of Truck is getting stronger, but the sound of": null, "talking does hit your ears. They're not that bad yet. So I'm gonna ask": null, "you, do you continue to chase down Truck?": null, "Erika: Oh, well, do the voices sound like they're raised? Or are they": null, "just talking?": null, "Aabria: You're used to status being asserted.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Mm.": null, "Aabria: It's what you do to your family. It's what you've done to your": null, "warren. RIP the Red Warren. The thing you hear isn't arguing. What": null, "you're hearing are commands being given, one voice louder and gruffer": null, "than the rest.": null, "Erika: I'd like to go over there and see that. It's good to know about": null, "what your neighbors are up to. I'm not saying that I'm a gossip or that": null, "I am paying extra attention to it, [Siobhan giggles] but it's just, you": null, "know, it pays to be aware.": null, "Siobhan: Who are you saying this to?": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0Who are you talking to?": null, "Izzy: Having that conversation in her head to herself.": null, "Erika: I am saying it fully out loud, muttering it to myself old lady": null, "style. [everyone laughs]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[laughs] Yeah.": null, "Erika: And be like, oh...": null, "Izzy: But I like that it's like, are you placing the judgement? Like, is": null, "someone else in your head going, \"What a gossip.\"": null, "Erika: Yeah, boy this is-": null, "Siobhan: Right, your mother is telling you off for gossiping. She's in": null, "there.": null, "Erika: Oh no, it's Beatrix. That's always like, \"Ah, you gossip, what a": null, "gossip.\"": null, "Izzy: She's dead.": null, "Erika: And I'm like, \"Yeah, but Beatrix is dead so like...\" [cast": null, "laughing]": null, "Aabria: You tell the ghost in your head that she's dead and it gets": null, "quiet. [laughs]": null, "Erika: Oh, oh, oh!": null, "Jasper: She shuts up real quick.": null, "Erika: Hush, hush now, hush now!": null, "Aabria: All right, are you coming over with your normal Ava rizz or are": null, "you gonna try to sneak?": null, "Erika: Oh, I'm going to sneak.": null, "Aabria: Okay, go ahead and give me a stealth check.": null, "Izzy: Even though you're speaking out loud to yourself.": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, yeah.": null, "Erika: I'm muttering.": null, "Aabria: Which was I was like, let me ask before 'cause the expectation": null, "would be like, walking with a very loud raccoon dick bone and being": null, "like, anyway-": null, "Izzy: [mimicking Ava] Oh, yeah, I'm not some sort of gossip!": null, "Erika:\u00a0Shit, yeah, uh...": null, "Aabria: Exactly.": null, "Erika: So I've slowed down to sort of a speed walk, you know, like a": null, "morning to early-morning speed walk.": null, "Aabria: You would knit the first hat, which is that little visor.": null, "Erika: Yeah. [slams table] [whisper] How did you know?": null, "Aabria: I'm from Irvine, California.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yeah, yeah, yeah!": null, "Aabria: I've had several of them.": null, "Erika: Got a visor.": null, "Izzy: Go stop in the park and move my arms around.": null, "Erika: Yeah, so I'm... [laughs] So I, you know, I got a four so I'm sort": null, "of like, rocking up. I'm rocking up, you know. [mumbles]": null, "Erika mimes busy old lady walking.": null, "Aabria: So you sort of hear everything begin to hush down a little bit": null, "from the lower voices, but not the big, booming voice that was giving": null, "orders to begin with. Those remain unchanged, and you see, as you round": null, "this bend, first Bennett. And then three stoats you don't recognize, two": null, "of them look almost identical to one another, and they, just like": null, "Bennett, have little sashes around their waist. And then one other": null, "stoat. The one that was very obviously giving orders if only from their": null, "bearing, and the fact that Bennett looks tiny next to them. [Erika": null, "gasps] If Bennett was large for a stoat, the stoat that is giving": null, "Bennett orders is just at a slightly different scale.": null, "Izzy: [silent] The Rock.": null, "Aabria: You would guess like, honestly, like The Rock. Like two to three": null, "times the mass of a normal stoat that you would see with some little": null, "circular decorations on their shoulders with a little bit of gold bits": null, "coming down. Their whiskers together curled into a little pattern, a": null, "design in the front. And not just a sash, but sort of wrapping fabric": null, "that flows out and away. Clothes, a word that your brain wouldn't know": null, "to know, and yet the stoat stands imperious and imposing and yet the": null, "stoat stands imperious and imposing and barks orders as Bennett, who": null, "sort of couldn't help but hear you come up, turns his head. Gives you a": null, "little,": null, "Bennett: Oh, good morning, Ava.": null, "Erika: [waves] Oh, good morning, Bennett.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Hi.": null, "Erika: How are you today?": null, "Bennett: I'm so good. You're up early.": null, "Ava: Well, I'm up at the kind of normal hour that I'm up. Sometimes I": null, "like to go and do movements very slowly in the park, [Rashawn and": null, "Siobhan giggle] but you know, we're settling in. We're in the blue": null, "corridor, you know, I think nine up and 13 to the left. And we're": null, "settling in quite nicely. You should come and visit sometime, yes. Who,": null, "who are these... I'm Ava.": null, "Izzy: Is this like a meeting?": null, "Aabria: A meeting, yeah. You just rocked up to a very important meeting": null, "just as-": null, "Ava: Oh, you must be the Carton twins. [players laughing]": null, "Aabria: Honestly, that's so good I'm... Like, a little inspiration,": null, "thank you. I was about to do the thing of like, reminding you of a thing": null, "you were told yesterday. But then these two twins turn to you and give": null, "you a deep bow perfectly in sync.": null, "Ava: So polite.": null, "Carter: [soft English accent] Yes, my name's Carter and this is my twin,": null, "Pep. Yes, we run Defense in the same way that Bennett, who I believe": null, "you've met, runs Resource Allocation.": null, "Cater: And then this, of course, is... [exhales sharply]": null, "Aabria: And the bigger stoat doesn't have to move forward and yet": null, "there's a sense of like, a hand wipe even as these other stoats are": null, "interposing themselves between you and them. They sort of wipe their": null, "hand away, and without knowing or seeing it, they part in front of them": null, "and just a little head nod.": null, "Kiran: [deep voice] I'm The Director, one of the First Stoats. You can": null, "call me Kiran.": null, "Ava: Karen?": null, "Kiran[Siobhan laughing]": null, "Ava: Kiran. Oh! Well, you look very good for 20 years old.": null, "Kiran: So do you. [chuckles] [Izzy \u201coohs\u201d]": null, "Ava: Oh. [players chuckling] Uh, if only, if only. I'm but a mere four": null, "and a half years, but I've got quite a few winters left in these old": null, "bones.": null, "Kiran: So I've heard. I was apprised of your assistance as the elk was": null, "being taken.": null, "Ava: [delighted] Oh, did Bennett tell you about me and about my": null, "children? Oh, Bennett!": null, "Aabria: And you see Bennett's kinda like, blushing and standing at the": null, "side like, I don't deal with this smoke at all. [players laughing]": null, "[Erika laughs mischievously] Kiran just sort of nods and like-": null, "Brennan: This is like an old woman wandering into a Joint Chiefs of": null, "Staff-": null, "Aabria: Truly! [players laughing]": null, "Brennan: And being like, [old lady voice] \"Mr. President, your Chief": null, "Admiral wants to sleep with one of my children.\" [players laughing]": null, "Aabria: That's exactly what's happening right now.": null, "Jasper: Even better, it's walking in going, \"Oh, sorry, you're in a": null, "meeting? Cool, anyways, so what were you saying?\"": null, "Aabria: You've wandered into the war room, and you're having a little": null, "convo.": null, "Erika: It's just nice. It's very the neighborly thing to do, yes.": null, "Siobhan: Osama Bin who? [cast laughing]": null, "Aabria: As Kiran kind of gives you a little bit of a smile, stoats": null, "normally have just rows of fangs and teeth. There's something very": null, "strange about Kiran's smile, the way that the sort of two main canine": null, "incisors the way that the sort of two main canine incisors are more": null, "sharp than a stoat's would be. It reminds you more of a wolf or some of": null, "the bigger cats that live in the area. But also that like, the teeth in": null, "the front and towards the back that you can see seem flattened out. So": null, "like, strangely flatter, more fanged, and then flatter in the back": null, "again.": null, "Ava: [disgusted]\u00a0Oh.": null, "Kiran: Is there something I can...": null, "Ava: What, uh, can I, may I\u2026": null, "Erika reaches out her hands.": null, "Kiran: Absolutely not!": null, "Ava: Oh.": null, "Aabria: And the moment you move forward, ranks are closed and you are": null, "absolutely stopped. No, thank you.": null, "Ava: Oh, well, well...": null, "Kiran: Your boldness is appreciated.": null, "Ava: Oh, why, thank you. It's one of my better traits, yes. So my": null, "daughter Viola and her husband Thorn-": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Oh boy.": null, "Ava: Really would very much like to meet with you and the other First": null, "Stoats.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Rashawn: [snaps fingers] Yes!": null, "Brennan collapses with laughter.": null, "Ava: Has many, many questions to ask, and I'm sure that the three of you": null, "could collaborate on something very exciting.

This guy's so huge!": null, "Rashawn: Golly, that's so in character.": null, "Brennan: [high-pitched]\u00a0Collaborate?": null, "Rashawn: Erika, you are awesome. [players laughing]": null, "Jasper: Truly so badass.": null, "Kiran: As for the First Stoats, there are four of us, and though we do": null, "not hide ourselves away from the population that we have bent the tenor": null, "of our lives to protect, we are not so easily sought out, though I": null, "appreciate your interest in the leadership of this community.": null, "Ava: Oh, well, I feel like it's, you know, if you're any sort of leader": null, "in a community you have to get together and share some blueberries with": null, "other people and, [gesticulating] you know, it's just a neighborly thing": null, "to do, you know? So you should come by. We're in the blue corridor on": null, "eight up and five across and...": null, "Kiran: [flatly] I know where you live.": null, "Ava: Oh! Oh, Bennett! [players guffaw]": null, "Aasbria: Truly, in this moment, give me an insight check.": null, "Jasper: Bennett is folding himself into himself.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Jasper: He's like, \"No!\"": null, "Aabria: Bennett would like to cease existing.": null, "Rashawn: \"If you're a good leader you should do this.\" is so bold.": null, "Erika: That is a dirty 20.": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria: Bennett looks absolutely like, he's not mortified you're": null, "bringing him up, but there's a mixture of one, the ping you get": null, "immediately is, I didn't tell them where you live. They know where you": null, "live. And other than that, this is the craziest conversation and it's": null, "wild that I am currently the fence between a brand-new old woman and": null, "this guy. So just truly shocked and staggered. And I think you get a lot": null, "of like, ah, the audacity! As like, a vibe you have normally, but this": null, "looks even more than you've seen or experienced before. Truly like, \"I": null, "cannot believe this is happening. Holy shit.\"": null, "Ava: Now, I'm not saying that the burrows could use a little bit of": null, "sprucing up, but it could be a little cozier, you know?

A bear? [scoffs] No. All of our Defense Forces are turned": null, "towards the only threat that would move a community this large into": null, "constant and frenetic motion.

We'll come back to you in a little bit. [to Jasper]": null, "Thorn, you are sort of up and awake, and everyone else is kind of doing": null, "those like, those pre-stirring when you know people are leaving deep": null, "sleep. What's on your mind right now?": null, "Jasper: Oof, I think Thorn is currently... It rarely happens 'cause I": null, "feel as a trained hunter and ranger he's always kind of like, scanning": null, "and taking information in. I think he's truly lost in his thoughts at": null, "this point. Trying to process what Viola and Tula said to him in that": null, "the idea that the Light was made by the humans I think has fundamentally": null, "rocked his foundations, you know?": null, "This entire belief system that he had made and the source of all his": null, "power, which he wants to channel everything into repelling these things,": null, "was made by them, and I think he is trying to reconcile that in his own": null, "mind before he kind of like, steps out or continues any part of that": null, "conversation from yesterday. So I think, yeah, like a little bit kind of": null, "absent-minded. Probably just like, place a paw kind of like, on Viola's": null, "paw as you're waking to sort of, just to feel that kind of sense of": null, "contact, but won't be kind of like, waking anyone up or anything.": null, "Aabria: Sure. [to Rashawn] Go ahead and give me a perception check.": null, "Rashawn: Six.": null, "Aabria: You know what, I'll leave it to you. It doesn't have to be a": null, "dice roll. Do you wake up?": null, "Rashawn: Mm, I open one eyeball, but it's this one. [switches eyes]": null, "Yeah, I open one eyeball and I go,": null, "Viola: What's got you troubled?": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Hm? Oh.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Something's wrong. I can feel it.": null, "Melancholy music plays.": null, "Thorn: I'm just thinking about yesterday. Tensions got a little high.": null, "[chuckles]": null, "Viola: Yeah, it was, you know, kind of our first fight in a way.": null, "Thorn: Yeah.": null, "Viola: I'm sorry that it had to come to that, but I just don't think": null, "they all know what they're really up against.": null, "Thorn: I completely agree, and I wanted to apologize because what": null, "that... [inhales deeply] Me pushing back on you in that moment wasn't...": null, "That wasn't fair because it was coming from a place of my own fear, and": null, "I was putting that on you. I don't know how to come to terms with the": null, "idea that everything I've ever believed could be some lie fabricated by": null, "these monsters, some creation of theirs that they carelessly discarded.": null, "And I agree with you that it is arrogant of us to suggest that we might": null, "know it better than them whilst I still have to hold onto the belief": null, "that we can wield it better than them.": null, "Viola: Our intention is to help, not destroy, though there is some": null, "destruction that's going to be part of it. And I think that using the": null, "Light with good intention negates all that other stuff. You got this far": null, "with your knowhow and your understanding, and we have to pivot. [Jasper": null, "nods] It would be foolish to think that we know more than they do.": null, "That's just arrogance.": null, "When we walked in here it seemed like they had everything under control.": null, "They've controlled... There are lots of people who don't ask any": null, "questions, and the fact that we're asking questions I think puts us a": null, "level above everybody else. 'Cause if we just follow along, we would be": null, "dead. We could have been slammed up against a tree, forgotten. They": null, "won't even speak their names out loud. It was hard for Sybil to say,": null, "\"Brother.\"": null, "Thorn: Yes. [clears throat]": null, "Viola: Imagine if you couldn't ever say mother or brother or sister or": null, "aunt or lover ever again, how empty that would be.": null, "Thorn: [choked up]\u00a0I don't know what life that would be if I couldn't": null, "say your name. [Rashawn smiles]": null, "Viola:\u00a0I think the more information we gather, the stronger that we are.": null, "Thorn: Mm-hmm.": null, "Viola: And the stronger that we are, the less likely that we'll perish.": null, "Thorn: I agree. So we've gotta check out this Reactor Charlie, right?": null, "Viola: Yes. Charlie is on my mind. I'd also like to speak to Quentin.": null, "Viola: Runs, I believe, the Technology unit 'cause I wanna know, what is": null, "their... If these humans come back, what is... Are there multiple plans": null, "or is it one big thing? Because they gotta have-": null, "Thorn: Yeah. We got an A through D situation.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Thorn: A through Z or just A.": null, "Viola: I would love to see a beat sheet.": null, "Thorn: Yeah, just a little play-by-play.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Exactly.": null, "Thorn: Yeah, that would be good for sure. [quietly] Could I just, could": null, "I grab you for one second?": null, "Viola: Sure.": null, "Jasper: And if we can sort of lead out just a little bit to do a little": null, "sidebar.": null, "Aabria: Sweet. As you go for more of a sidebar, which again, sidebar": null, "declared, I still want... Can you give me a perception check?": null, "Brennan: Yeah, uh-huh.": null, "Aabria: [furtively]\u00a0The mother always lies in wait.": null, "Brennan: Perception's gonna be a 22.": null, "Aabria: Damn. Yeah, you for sure come to consciousness hearing the": null, "murmured conversations. I'll say you caught the back half of that": null, "conversation, and you are fully awake as you hear them moving off,": null, "sequestering themselves further for more conversation that, this is the": null, "bit that you know you won't be able to hear.": null, "Brennan: Okay, I am going to very, I'm gonna very softly rouse myself.": null, "And while my kids are sleeping, I'm just gonna whisper to my children,": null, "Tula: Do you wanna sleep longer or do you wanna come with me to get": null, "breakfast? [Siobhan snorts in excitement] [Erika and Jasper chuckling]": null, "Jaysohn, do you wanna come with me to get breakfast? [Siobhan nods]": null, "Lila, do you wanna come or do you wanna sleep? [Izzy nods] Okay, up and": null, "at 'em. Let's go, we have to wait in line.": null, "And I just know that we have to go get food for everybody so I'm gonna": null, "go wait in line for breakfast.": null, "Aabria: Cool, so as you guys step away to have a more private": null, "conversation you're like, what uncanny timing as the rest of the family": null, "moves.": null, "Tula: I'm gonna head to that line to go get breakfast, but I'll bring": null, "some back. If they allow me to, I'll bring some back for the whole": null, "family.": null, "Viola: Yes, and something for Thorn as well.": null, "Tula: Yes, absolutely.": null, "Viola: Good morning, everyone.": null, "Jaysohn: Good morning.": null, "Thorn: Morning.": null, "Lila: Hi.": null, "Viola: How'd you sleep?": null, "Siobhan: Jaysohn doesn't understand that question. [cast laughing]": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Excellent.": null, "Jaysohn: I just close my eyes and then I wake up later.": null, "Aabria: [laughs] How.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0That's how I sleep.": null, "Viola: Jaysohn, do you not dream?": null, "Jaysohn: Do you sleep in a different way?": null, "Viola: Do you not dream? Do you not allow your-": null, "Jaysohn: [emphatically] Oh, I dream so much! Yeah! [Aabria laughing]": null, "Thorn: Jaysohn, have you never had a bad night's sleep?": null, "Tula: He's had many bad night's sleeps, but he doesn't understand...": null, "It's all good.": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Tula: You had a big meal yesterday. We ate a bunch of rabbit, right?": null, "Jaysoh : Yeah, it was really good.": null, "Tula: So it's nice to sleep on a full stomach.": null, "Jaysohn: Oh my goodness, it's so nice. And then I dreamt that I was": null, "chasing the rabbits, and then I caught the rabbit, but then it kept": null, "going and I killed it and I ate it but then it kept going and then I was": null, "chasing it. It was a skeleton and it was really cool.": null, "Brennan: I look at like a scratch in my fur on this side of my body.": null, "It's like,": null, "Tula: I know you were dreaming last night. [cast laughing] Yes, yes,": null, "yes.": null, "Aabria: [claps] A killer.": null, "Tula: All right, we're gonna go get breakfast. See you later.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna take off with the kids.": null, "Aabria: Perfect.": null, "Thorn: I'm not really too sure how to phrase this, so I will just say": null, "it. [soft instrumental music] I have a concern that there was a lot of": null, "influence on us as a family, there were a lot of voices, and I": null, "appreciate those and I want to listen to them and take them all in, but": null, "I want to ask one thing. If the time should come where a decision has to": null, "be made to run or stay, that it is our decision whether we run or stay.": null, "And I mean mine and yours together, and that if we think the best thing": null, "is to stay that we stay and that if we think the best thing is to stay": null, "that we stay because we also have-": null, "Viola: Mm-hmm.": null, "Thorn: Children to consider. And I'm not asking you to go against your": null, "family. If we should decide, if Tula decides that she wants to leave and": null, "that's what we decide is also the best thing, then absolutely we will go": null, "with Tula and Ava and the children, of course. But if we feel in our": null, "heart the best thing to do, the safest thing to do is to stay and fight,": null, "[shakily] then we stay and fight, and I know that's a really hard thing": null, "to ask of you.": null, "Thorn: [voice breaking] But I cannot lose you.": null, "Viola: If you want to run, I will run wherever you go. It's more than us": null, "right now. And yes, I love my family and I love what we've built, but": null, "it's not worth it if we're all gone. If there's a command word or": null, "something that you wanna, like a safeword that you wanna say and then we": null, "take off and we go, I'll go.": null, "Thorn: It will always be our decision, Viola. I wouldn't have a clue": null, "what I was doing if it wasn't for you so tell you what, you come up with": null, "a command word and then I'll know. [chuckles]": null, "Viola: Okay, I'll think on something. But yes, it's our decision. Your": null, "decisions are our decisions. My decisions are our decisions.": null, "Rashawn: And I guess Viola just kinda looks out into the expanse of all": null, "of these people and is thinking like, worst case scenario, how do we get": null, "out? Like, kind of making like a fire escape plan-": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0In her mind.": null, "Aabria: What are you trying to figure out in this moment? Like, how to": null, "get out if you need to get out?": null, "Rashawn: Yeah, oh, I would want to know what the evacuation plan that's": null, "already kind of set and maybe do the opposite of what they have planned": null, "for themselves. Like, if everybody is going to go to the side door, I": null, "would go to the back door because that's gonna bottleneck. That's gonna": null, "be a lot of traffic.": null, "Aabria: Sure, okay. I like this. If you are trying to figure this out": null, "just on the sort of way things are set up because like, systems are": null, "fairly intuitive, I'm gonna say that's a survival check. If you are": null, "trying to understand what the plan here is with any sort of": null, "preternatural clarity, arcana check. You tell me what you wanna roll.": null, "Jasper: Would I be able to, with the secret mission that I was sort of": null, "hoping to accomplish with Jaysohn, which is kind of like, try to study": null, "the layout and patterns and recognizing patterns and stuff, would I be": null, "able to assist with this? If I'm sort of explaining...": null, "Aabria: I think in this moment I'm gonna leave it just on her [to": null, "Rashawn] as you lean into what you know and what your priorities are.": null, "And it's not that like, you aren't good collaborators, but there's": null, "something about the just like, what am I clocking really quickly in and": null, "of myself? Who are you by yourself in this moment?": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0I'm gonna use arcana.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. [die taps table]": null, "Rashawn: 18. [Izzy chuckles]": null, "Aabria:\u00a018.": null, "Siobhan: That's my aunt.": null, "Aabria: I'll give you a little of both. You start with the flow of what": null, "everything is here. Everything that the stoats have added and built is": null, "made to try to get people to move as efficiently as possible. There's": null, "ways, like, there's lots of ways up and into these rows and rows of": null, "little nests and homes. Easy paths up and down. Easy ways for you to": null, "make your way to wherever you're headed within Last Bast. Low or across": null, "the walls or across scaffolding, everything is for easy and rapid": null, "transport so people don't get clogged places. But the exits are not open": null, "and easy. This place is not meant to have an escape plan.": null, "You understand truly well that this is the fallback position and if Last": null, "Bast falls, so goes everyone. [slow uneasy music] There are exits. You": null, "know you can get in and out. But there's no sense of like, \"and then we": null, "swing open these wide doors and everyone flees out.\" There's no sense of": null, "like, you weren't given information as you were being onboarded with": null, "like, \"In the event of an emergency, head here, here, or here.\" That's": null, "not what this place is.": null, "Rashawn: That makes her-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's a bunker.": null, "Rashawn: Yeah, bunker. No freedom. Can't move the way you want to. As an": null, "outside cat, I don't like it.": null, "Aabria: I will come in and qualify, it's not a lack of freedom to move": null, "the way you want to. No one's progress is impeded. But the point of this": null, "place isn't easy and open ingress and egress. Like, you leave when you": null, "have to go somewhere. But the point isn't, everyone's just flowing in": null, "and out constantly or you would have seen more people outside. You go": null, "outside because you have to go outside. You go outside because you need": null, "to do something to like, serve the community or grab something for": null, "yourself.": null, "And even to that end, like, you weren't seeing people, like when you": null, "came in, you weren't seeing people that looked at you and your family": null, "crazy going like, \"Oh, how'd they, they get to go in and out.\" Like,": null, "there was no sense of that. Like, the priority of the people here isn't": null, "like, \"Well, I gotta figure out an opportunity to get out.\" Like, this": null, "isn't North Korea. It's just, there isn't an instinct to do that because": null, "everyone is on the same page.": null, "Rashawn: Gosh it, that's... That's cool information. Thank you for that.": null, "Aabria: [brightly] Oh my God. You're welcome. Says the universe or your": null, "own heart or whatever gave you that information.": null, "Rashawn: Sugar, okay. I guess I relay that to you.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Yes, so I, you know, it may be harder to get out if we need to": null, "get out, if we want to get out, but we can get out.": null, "Thorn: Yes, it sort of draws me back to what Sybil said yesterday. The": null, "idea that stoats have come from every which direction The idea that": null, "stoats have come from every which direction so my instinct right now is": null, "that we stay and fight.": null, "Viola: And that's what we will do.": null, "Aabria: I like that. And let's go move now to the person with the": null, "biggest fuck off instinct of them all. Tula, where are you and your kids": null, "headed? [laughs]": null, "Brennan: So we were told that food comes from a line. So I think Tula is": null, "thinking about breakfast. Is thinking about... And I think in all": null, "honesty Tula woke up and is like, ah, Mama is gone. [Aabria laughs] And": null, "we've been here for less than 24 hours, and I hear Viola and Thorn": null, "conspiring out in the hallway. And well, I guess I'll get food. I'll go": null, "get food. [laughs]": null, "Rashawn: Oh my God. [laughs]": null, "Brennan: Yeah. It becomes immediately very obvious that like, whatever": null, "you're thinking and working on and dealing with your kids, like, there": null, "is no like, great investigation check. You see that as people are waking": null, "up and also flowing down from their relative nests, everyone's moving in": null, "one big direction to a side room under a bunch of like, walkways. And": null, "there's just a big distribution mechanism. Like, the closer you get to": null, "it, the more you see people are naturally queuing up and walking back": null, "with like, big bundles of like, meat and fish flesh and little metal": null, "cups, and fish flesh and little metal cups, basins of water held in paws": null, "and little bric-a-brac and sometimes wrapped in leaves. As they pass you": null, "like, good morning, good morning, hi.": null, "Tula: Well, this place is very exciting. There's so many other stoats": null, "here.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, that's Lukas.": null, "Tula: Oh!": null, "Lukas:\u00a0[congested] Mint, Mama! I had mint and I need it to live!": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Um, uh...": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Full meltdown.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna look over at Lukas and say,": null, "Tula:\u00a0hi, are you Lukas?": null, "Lukas: I'm Lukas.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Oh-": null, "Lukas: [gasps] It's the bosses of me! Hi.": null, "Tula: The what?": null, "Jaysohn: Hi.": null, "Lukas: They're the boss of me.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0I'm not your boss.": null, "Tula: Jaysohn.": null, "Jaysohn: I don't-": null, "Tula: Why is Lukas telling me-": null, "Lila:\u00a0We gave you back!": null, "Tula: That you're boss of him?": null, "Lila: We gave him back!": null, "Brennan:\u00a0What do you mean-": null, "Jaysohn: We gave him back to Education.": null, "Tula: You gave him back?": null, "Lukas: They gave me back, but my allegiance remains with Jaysohn and": null, "Lila.": null, "Tula: Is your nose stuffy?": null, "Lukas: Yeah.": null, "Tula: Come here, come here, come here. [he mimes grabbing Aabria\u2019s head]": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to Lay on Hands five points to cure a disease,": null, "and I'm just gonna blow into one of his nostrils.": null, "Aabria: Yeah! [claps]": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Brennan: [blows sharply] Just catch a bunch of snot. [players groaning": null, "in disgust]": null, "Aabria: Amazing! [Siobhan and Rashawn retching] A snot rocket like,": null, "scatters across the ground. [Siobhan groans] [cast member snorts]": null, "Tula: Oh, there you go, sweetie.": null, "Lukas: [no longer congested] Oh my God! Mom! That lady's mouth is mint!": null, "[Siobhan giggles] Hi.": null, "Tula: Hi, um-": null, "Lukas: I pledge my allegiance to your family forever!": null, "Tula: Oh, that's very-": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, you gotta stop giving yourself away, it's weird.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[taking deep breaths] Okay.": null, "Tula:\u00a0That's all right.": null, "Jaysohn: But you can be our friend.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna look for, is his mom right around here?": null, "Aabria: [laughs] She's got that dead stare of just, this was a kid that": null, "was melting down seconds ago and she's just... He's been kicking and": null, "punching her and she's just moving slowly forward like,": null, "Meredith: [tiredly] Yeah, hi. Thank you so much for-": null, "Tula:\u00a0Oh, of course.": null, "Meredith: Biting my child's congestion out of his face.": null, "Tula: Of course, you're more than welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm": null, "Tula.": null, "Meredith: Oh, hi. My name's Meredith.": null, "Tula: Meredith, it's so lovely to meet you.": null, "Meredith:\u00a0It's so lovely to meet you.": null, "Tula: I'm so glad. My children have just started in Education. And Lukas": null, "was so sweet to them on the first day.": null, "Lila: And ended.": null, "Meredith: Oh, yes.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, we're not going back there. We actually figured it out.": null, "Tula: All right, well-": null, "Lila:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Tula: We'll talk about that in a moment, but...": null, "Meredith: Simon's a bit of a pushover and just-": null, "Tula:\u00a0Oh, I see.": null, "Meredith: Normally the children here are quite happy to just be around": null, "other children. [yawns] You're new then? If they're new. [sniffles]": null, "Tula:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Meredith: Are you a recent addition to Last Bast?": null, "Tula: Yes. We just joined yesterday. It's lovely.": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Oh, how wonderful.": null, "Tula: Thank you so much for having us.": null, "Meredith: Yes, thank you. You already have proved incredible value. My": null, "child is hyperventilating in the corner now.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yes, and I would lean in and go-": null, "Meredith: Thank you.": null, "Tula: And by the way, if, you know, we have so much more space in our": null, "burrow than ever so if Lukas ever wants to come over and play, if you'd": null, "ever like some time for you and your-": null, "Aabria: I'm just gonna... And she just leans in and gets very close to": null, "your face.": null, "Tula: Yeah, I understand. Yeah, you-": null, "Meredith: This is one of those things where you have to take it back now": null, "'cause if I get to hold that hope in my heart and then later you're": null, "like, Lukas can't come over-": null, "Tula:\u00a0I'm not going to take it back.": null, "Meredith: It will kill me.": null, "Siobhan and Izzy grimace at each other at the thought of a playdate with": null, "Lukas.": null, "Tula: These two are the most it's possible to be so we're already at the": null, "limit. So if we add another, it actually doesn't make a difference to": null, "me, you understand?": null, "Meredith: I do actually understand that.": null, "Tula:\u00a0If there's a third-": null, "Meredith: Thank you so much.": null, "Tula:\u00a0You understand?": null, "Meredith: Yes.": null, "Tula: The difference between none and two is infinity so [cast laughing]": null, "adding three, you can't get more than infinity.": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Yeah, that's fair.": null, "Tula: You understand? Yeah, absolutely. Well-": null, "Meredith: That's very nice. Thank you so much. I'm staying in the...": null, "We're in the red corridor. I'll send... He'll find you later. Are you": null, "sending them back to Education? And we can exchange information there if": null, "that's easier.": null, "Tula: Yeah.": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Or just, uh...": null, "Tula: I assume that's the right thing to do unless there's other... Are": null, "there other-": null, "Meredith: Well, I wasn't sure if you'd figured out like, a job or": null, "something or what you wanted to do. There's no pressure-": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, I wanna get a job.": null, "Meredith: You want a job, little boy?": null, "Jaysohn: I'm actually really big. [Izzy grins and blinks]": null, "Meredith: Yeah, okay. [laughs]": null, "Aabria: This a woman with, almost like your mother, no fight in her": null, "about that. Like, absolutely. Like, I don't want that smoke, no.": null, "Tula: Actually, and I was wondering because I think both of my children": null, "are very excited about Refit.": null, "Meredith: Refit?": null, "Jaysohn: No! [Erika laughing] You're not listening to us at all!": null, "Lila: We're actually really excited about lab secrets.": null, "Jaysohn: Labs and secrets. [players laughing] And weapons and fighting!": null, "Meredith: Oh, I'm so sorry, what? Hold on, I'm so sorry, what? Lab": null, "secrets?": null, "Lila: Yes.": null, "Jaysohn: Lila's really clever. Lila can read-": null, "Tula: Lila-": null, "Meredith: Interesting. What have you heard about lab secrets?": null, "Lila: I sorta found it out on my own.": null, "Meredith: Mm-hmm.": null, "Lila: That um, you know, there are bunch of secrets and-": null, "Meredith: What kind of secrets?": null, "Lila:\u00a0That like, people who are in charge-": null, "Meredith: I work in a lab.": null, "Lila: Yeah, I know. [she grins]": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Yeah, you're awesome.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she give a little look to-": null, "Lila: You're awesome. Lukas is awesome.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0She gives a little look at Lukas.": null, "Lila: We love Lukas.": null, "Aabria: And Lukas shrinks back. And it's the most neutral look, and you": null, "see Lukas looks like he has been struck with a wave of like, this is...": null, "Not hit, like he's not flinching like a hit child, but more like, this": null, "is the thing you know not to talk about.": null, "Brennan: Can I make an insight check into Meredith here?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Absolutely.": null, "Rashawn: [whisper] Don't talk about the family business.": null, "Brennan: 24. [Aabria laughs]": null, "Aabria: That's crazy. [laughs] Yeah, I mean, you pick that up right": null, "away. Like, this is a very tired mom with a high-energy, just a little": null, "psychopath that she has. Very 'only child' energy. And this is one of": null, "those things where it's like, a mom who said, \"I want you to, like, do": null, "what you do and I'm not going to keep secrets from you, but the thing we": null, "don't talk about is my work in the lab.\"": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: That like, you don't share that with the other children. And you": null, "know that he doesn't know exactly what she does, but the way she": null, "immediately clamped down on that, she does something that like, does not": null, "get out.": null, "Tula:\u00a0We're not gonna.": null, "Lila: He actually didn't tell us. I just could tell.": null, "Jaysohn: 'Cause Lila's really clever.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Lila: But you looked at him and he got scared.": null, "Meredith: Sure. Well, he knows he's not supposed to talk too much.": null, "Lila: But he didn't!": null, "Jaysohn: He didn't. He actually could barely talk because he had a": null, "blocked nose.": null, "Lila:\u00a0He can't breathe.": null, "Jaysohn: And then once he had the mint, all he talked about was mint.": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Mm-hmm, okay.": null, "Jaysohn: He really didn't talk about anything but mint.": null, "Meredith: Sure.": null, "Tula: Meredith, I think that the kids are very excited about all of the": null, "new things going on in the Last Bast.": null, "Lila: We're just trying to keep\u2026 [she fidgets in impatience]": null, "Tula: But I'd be interested in talking to you about where you think the": null, "ideal places to go are. We were lucky enough to meet Bennett yesterday": null, "on our way in.": null, "Meredith: Resource Allocation.": null, "Tula: Yeah, we saw there was a hunt concluding.": null, "Meredith: Oh.": null, "Tula: Out as we arrived yesterday.": null, "Lila: Our grandma went into it.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah.": null, "Tula: And she-": null, "Jaysohn: Our grandma's really strong.": null, "Tula: Well, yeah.": null, "Meredith:\u00a0What were they hunting?": null, "Jaysohn: Just like me.": null, "Tula: Yeah. Hm?": null, "Meredith: What were they hunting?": null, "Lila:\u00a0Moose.": null, "Tula:\u00a0They were a large sort of antler-covered elk.": null, "Aabria: Just drafting off of that previous insight check, and I'll let": null, "you kind of pick this up a little bit, too. That her asking a little too": null, "casually, \"What were they hunting?\" Was absolutely a like, did you see": null, "the thing that they were actually hunting or is this the like, yeah, you": null, "saw them looking for rabbits, sure.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, so I'm like,": null, "Tula: Yeah, so we saw them driving an elk into the enclosure with the": null, "other monster, the other beast that was in there so-": null, "Aabria: I think at this point she's just like, losing the ability to": null, "hide it like... You've seen so much.": null, "Lila: That was just walking up.": null, "Jaysohn: Oh, we killed a bear. Just us.": null, "Meredith: First day.": null, "Lila: And we're just trying to keep our family and your family safe.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Lila: By wanting to know the lab secrets, actually.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Lila: Because we just like, got here.": null, "Jaysohn: We're just minutes in.": null, "Lila: And it's like, what? We're like, doing all of this secret stuff.": null, "Jaysohn: Right, and then we have to go to this Education thing, which is": null, "just pointless.": null, "Lila: Yeah, and everyone's like, talking shit about Simon all time.": null, "Jaysohn: And we have to line up for food.": null, "Tula: Sweetie!": null, "Jaysohn: Instead of just going and killing a rabbit.": null, "Tula: We're just meeting Meredith.": null, "Jaysohn: Like, the rabbits are right there. Why can't we just go kill a": null, "rabbit?": null, "Lila:\u00a0You can.": null, "Meredith: Oh, we have to stockpile this. Everyone goes in that way.": null, "Jaysohn: But I'm hungry now.": null, "Lila: We're in line for food.": null, "Meredith: Right. You're in line for the rabbits that were caught earlier": null, "and they're being actively slaughtered.": null, "Jaysohn: So somebody else killed the rabbit? I'm not a baby. I can kill": null, "my own rabbit.": null, "Meredith: So why don't you join Resource Allocation then?": null, "Jaysohn: Exactly! No!": null, "Tula: Yes. [players laughing]": null, "Aabria: Incredible.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, there's a deep mom Xanatos is like, \"It's all going": null, "according to plan.\"": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Let me say, what was your name again?": null, "Jaysohn: Jaysohn.": null, "Meredith: Resource Allocation is mostly going out and hunting in the": null, "woods.": null, "Lila: We watched a stoat get killed yesterday in Resource Allocation.": null, "[Erika laughs]": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Yeah, but I wouldn't be killed.": null, "Meredith: Well, the thing that you saw being hunted-": null, "Lila: His name was Curtis.": null, "Aabria narrows her eyes.": null, "Jaysohn: Ssh! [Jasper exhales sharply]": null, "Meredith: Hm. Well, that's very unfortunate for them. Normally, Resource": null, "Allocation work is not that dangerous. What you saw-": null, "Jaysohn: Well, then I don't wanna do it.": null, "Meredith: Was something very special. I think if you haven't experienced": null, "much death in your life, that you're a very lucky stoat.": null, "Lila: [emphatically] Oh, we have!": null, "Jaysohn: [excitedly] Oh my goodness! Let me tell you about death.": null, "Lila: Our whole house died!": null, "Jaysohn: Our grandpa, he is dead, and our dad...": null, "Jaysohn and Lila: He is dead.": null, "Jaysohn: And then there was a guy who was trying to be our second dad,": null, "and he's dead.": null, "Lila: Dead.": null, "Jaysohn: Our Auntie Beatrix, she's dead.": null, "Jaysohn: All of our Uncle Thorn's friends except for two of them who are": null, "the ones who have the mint, they're all dead.": null, "Lila: Dead. The bear, dead.": null, "Jaysohn: Bear, dead.": null, "Lila: All the chipmunks-": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0All of the chipmunks.": null, "Lila: Inside the bear, dead.": null, "Jaysohn: Dead because of us. We killed those.": null, "Lila: Yeah.": null, "Tula: My children are very excited to be here in Last Bast. [players": null, "laughing] And so I'd love... Has anyone ever been hurt or injured or": null, "killed in Refit?": null, "Meredith: I think injuries do happen, yes.": null, "Lila: One time at the warren, I saw a guy walking into a hole and a rock": null, "fell on his head and he died. [Brennan laughing]": null, "Meredith: I think that's the sad truth about stoats.": null, "Lila:\u00a0So my mom is, yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Meredith: Is death is everywhere.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Yeah!": null, "Meredith: And everyone that made their way here-": null, "Lila: Our heads are too small and our bodies are too long! [cast": null, "laughing] So if you get hit in the head, it's over!": null, "Jaysohn: It's over. It's over.": null, "Meredith: What's your name again?": null, "Lila: Lila. [players laughing]": null, "Meredith:\u00a0You are absolutely correct. Our bodies are long and our heads": null, "are very weak, and that's why we move so quickly.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Meredith: But some of the things that we do here are not what it's in": null, "our instincts to do.": null, "Meredith: We are trying to do newer and more interesting things, and": null, "when you learn new skills-": null, "Lila: Mm-hmm, like make weapons.": null, "Meredith: You are full of secrets.": null, "Aabria: And I think you say that, and you saw that every time you sort": null, "of dropped big information, a big bit of information it sort of hit her.": null, "You saw like, it ripple across her like, what does this little girl": null, "know? And at that one, all of the pretense of being very like, kind and": null, "trying to move though advice stops and she just moves back up to": null, "standing.": null, "Meredith: Hm, well, my son and I ought to be going.": null, "And Lukas is just like,": null, "Lukas: [not congested] No, I can breathe! I can wait in the line": null, "forever. I'm feeling so good.": null, "And she's like,": null, "Meredith: We have food at home. Why don't we go home?": null, "Brennan: Can I make an insight check? I wanna see if there's antagonism": null, "towards my kid here.": null, "Aabria: Sure. Give me an insight check.": null, "Brennan: Like, it's one thing if she's like, oops, I need to lock it": null, "down.": null, "Aabria: Fuck, I rolled good! Now you have to beat a 23. I did the best,": null, "almost the best I could do.": null, "Izzy: Can I help her with how insightful I also am?": null, "Aabria: No.": null, "Brennan: 16.": null, "Aabria: Oh. You don't see antagonism toward her. Like, she doesn't feel": null, "anything strongly about this child, but what you do see even with a 16": null, "is that she has just logged a problem. [haunting sinister music] [Jasper": null, "exhales softly]": null, "Brennan: I'm going to look at her and say,": null, "Tula: well, the offer stands if you'd ever like a hand with Lukas.": null, "Meredith: Oh, thank you so much. That's very, very kind.": null, "Lila: Yeah, Lukas you should come over-": null, "Tula: Sweetie I'm gonna-": null, "Meredith:\u00a0Yes, of course.": null, "Tula: [sharply] Let me talk to Meredith right now.": null, "Izzy and Siobhan make faces at the rebuke": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Sure.": null, "Tula:\u00a0And by the way, if you ever want-": null, "Aabria: She pulls Lukas closer to her 'cause Lukas is now trying to": null, "like, look out at your kids.": null, "Tula: And I wanna send them back to Education, but I'm worried that when": null, "they got back from Education the other day they started saying a lot of": null, "really worrisome things about weapons and lab and all this other stuff.": null, "And it just feels like there's a lot of agitating things happening at": null, "Education that I-": null, "Aabria: Give me a deception check.": null, "All: Oh! [players shout]": null, "Aabria: Give me a deception check. That's so good!": null, "Brennan: Can I get any help from any of my kids in this moment?": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, they were talking about weapons.": null, "Lila: I'm like, [whisper] Lukas, come over-": null, "Jaysohn: And they were like- You have a weapon.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Well, let me be very clear. \u00a0I'm gonna ask you guys sort of": null, "like, player questions. Your mom just snapped on you to like, be quiet.": null, "Aabria: While adults were talking. Would you have listened to her and": null, "fallen back or would you reinsert yourself into this conversation,": null, "disobeying your mother's orders?": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Mm, I think we're-": null, "Izzy: I don't think we're reinserting ourselves.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, I don't think so. I think that she snapped so hard in a": null, "way that she almost never does.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Brennan: Mm-hmm.": null, "Siobhan: That I don't think-": null, "Izzy:\u00a0But we're also sort of like-": null, "Siobhan: Like maybe we're behind her. [mouthing to Izzy]": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Okay, she's mad.": null, "Siobhan: And going, I don't know what I said. What?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sweet.": null, "Siobhan: I don't even know.": null, "Aabria: I respect the like, fidelity of the moment, and you do not have": null, "advantage.": null, "Brennan: Cool.": null, "Aabria: The moment Meredith was done with you, Lukas was pulled in": null, "close. And like, even him trying to squirm away, she is keeping him": null, "tight, tightly tucked and is trying to get away.": null, "Brennan: 10. [Erika yelps]": null, "Jasper: Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.": null, "Jasper: Oy, oy, oy. [apprehensive piano music]": null, "Meredith: Yes, okay, well then I will absolutely check in with Education": null, "and see what's going on. It's unfortunate. Simon, though being a bit of": null, "a pushover normally, keeps a tight ship. And it's strange that such": null, "worrisome fantasies are sort of coming out of Education.": null, "Tula: To be clear, I wouldn't blame Simon at all. I didn't have a chance": null, "to meet him. The children's uncle brought them to Education yesterday.": null, "[Rashawn and Jasper gasp] I was more worried about some of the other": null, "children in the class and the fact that they seem to be able to run": null, "around and, you know, it doesn't seem like there's a tremendous amount": null, "of order in that room.": null, "Meredith: Understood. Oh, well, all right, Lukas. I guess we'll have a": null, "little conversation about what's going on in Education.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0By the way, I am-": null, "Meredith: And get to the bottom of it.": null, "Brennan: Fully trying to throw Lukas under the bus.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, 100 percent": null, "Brennan: Lukas can catch whatever fucking consequences he needs to.": null, "[players laughing] Tough fucking titties, Lukas. [players laughing]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I think, like-": null, "Erika: Wow!": null, "Aabria: In this moment your persuasion went off the way it did, but I": null, "think your insight and the insight that you've rolled and your passives,": null, "like, I think you're catching pretty obviously that she is rip cording": null, "out of any sort of understanding with you, too, and she's not picking up": null, "what you're putting down but is just trying to be nice and exit the": null, "conversation.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yeah, got it": null, "Aabria: But sure, like, of course. Her kid's a little shit and you knew": null, "that before so he's gonna catch a fade.": null, "Brennan: Any fucking smoke I can throw.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Brennan: That's like, my kids aren't trying to crack your weird,": null, "fucked-up city! You have a talkative fucking kid!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, absolutely.": null, "Brennan: Is just, let's throw that narrative up in the mix.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Brennan: I'm going-": null, "Rashawn: That's awesome. [Brennan laughs] I like it.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna turn to Lila and Jaysohn.": null, "Tula: Let's get breakfast and let's not talk to any other adults until": null, "we get back to the burrow with some food, okay? Thank you.": null, "Lila: She was mean.": null, "Tula:\u00a0What's that?": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, she was kinda mean. And we were just asking questions.": null, "It's not rude.": null, "Tula: You're both very bright young children. What do you think might": null, "happen if you keep asking a mean person questions?": null, "Lila: Kill us.": null, "Tula: Yeah, that's a good guess.": null, "Lila: Oh!": null, "Tula: [emphatically] Lila, that's a good guess. So we just gotta be": null, "careful, okay?": null, "Aabria: My three here, give me a perception check.": null, "Siobhan: 21.": null, "Brennan: 10.": null, "Izzy: 14.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Jaysohn.": null, "Siobhan: Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: As your family finishes collecting food, and you are without,": null, "literally without any question, they just ask you, food for how many?": null, "And you're picking up your sort of breakfast for the day. You cannot": null, "help but notice that several stoats You cannot help but notice that": null, "several stoats with copper wire wrapped around their sashes always have": null, "eyes on you and your mother and your sister.": null, "Siobhan: And do I get the impression that they are just interested in us": null, "'cause we're new? Or do I get the impression that we're like, kinda": null, "being hunted?": null, "Aabria: With a 21, this does not look like you are being hunted because": null, "you don't feel like you're being stalked into a place.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Uh-huh.": null, "Aabria: But it is very clear that like, whichever direction Meredith and": null, "Lukas took off in, like, a signal was thrown and you're being watched.": null, "Siobhan: Okay, I'm gonna pull on my mom's sash.": null, "Siobhan: And I'm gonna point this out to her.": null, "Brennan: Okay.": null, "Aabria: Give me a stealth check.": null, "Siobhan: 26.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. You're able to do it in a way that isn't like, you making": null, "eyes with one of them and being like-": null, "Aabria: Mom, they're looking at you! You're like, yeah.": null, "Siobhan: Look at these people!": null, "Aabria: Yeah, look at these people all here looking at you. [Siobhan and": null, "Aabria point wildly]": null, "Brennan: Yeah, whatever you say to me I'm going to, okay.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, and I'd really like some, the legs of the rabbit 'cause I": null, "really like the legs of the rabbit.": null, "Tula: Okay.": null, "Jaysohn: And I would love an ear of a rabbit also so I can just like,": null, "chew on it for later. [Brennan sighs]": null, "Siobhan: Whisper then.": null, "Brennan: Yeah. I'm gonna just say, okay, and I'm not going to look. I'm": null, "gonna just take my son's word for it. And I'm gonna say,": null, "Tula: Okay, very, very curious. You are both very curious young": null, "children. When you can see something, it can see you. It's not always": null, "safe to go looking for things. If you are going to hunt, half the hunt": null, "is not getting seen yourself.": null, "Jaysohn: Right.": null, "Brennan: That's all, okay?": null, "Jaysohn: So we have to do that thing that Uncle Thorn does that makes us": null, "invisible.": null, "Tula: There's lots of ways of getting seen. You can get seen by a": null, "monster and it will charge you, but sometimes you don't want the things": null, "in here [points to his head] to get spotted either. And those can get": null, "spotted by just asking a question a little bit too bluntly. You have to": null, "think about how important it is just to not be noticed.": null, "Right now we've been running around and doing all sorts of things, and": null, "there's almost no reason for that to be good. and there's almost no": null, "reason for that to be good. If I knew nothing else other than I could be": null, "in a place where people wouldn't pay attention to me or be in a place": null, "where people would, I would pick a place where they were not paying": null, "attention to me.": null, "Lila: Should we go for a walk outside? [Siobhan gasps excitedly]": null, "Tula: That sounds really nice.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah!": null, "Tula: I think that's a good idea.": null, "Jaysohn: Yes.": null, "Tula: But we're gonna get breakfast first 'cause we can't do anything on": null, "an empty stomach, and we have to bring some breakfast back to the": null, "burrow.": null, "Aabria: You make your way back to the burrow. And I think by the time": null, "everyone sort of gets back there, you three get back there, Ava, you've": null, "made your way back, too. And you are all together again with food and": null, "water, ample, easily distributed and cheerfully shared. I need Thorn,": null, "Viola, and Ava to make perception checks. [dice tapping table]": null, "Rashawn: Five.": null, "Jasper: 15.": null, "Aabria: Thorn, it's a little strange when they get back. You notice and": null, "you're just like, huh. Just, it's like a slight change. You are used to": null, "the smell of your family, and yet they came back and there's just like a": null, "slightly strange smell to the three of them.": null, "Jasper: Would this be anywhere similar to like, when we might mark our": null, "territory perhaps?": null, "Aabria: Yes.": null, "Izzy: [whisper] Somebody peed on us.": null, "Thorn: Ooh, oh, okay. Whew! [clears throat] How was the line for the": null, "food?": null, "Jaysohn: Oh, it was so boring and so long.": null, "Thorn: Was it super boring?": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, it was really boring.": null, "Thorn: Oh, okay.": null, "Tula: Well, we ran-": null, "Siobhan: Jaysohn just took that so literally and was just-": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's the best part is like-": null, "Siobhan: The line was really boring. [Aabria laughing]": null, "Tula: We ran into Lukas from Education.": null, "Thorn: Oh.": null, "Tula: And we met his mother, Meredith who was a little bit, seems a": null, "little tired and just a little bit guarded. She seemed a little guarded": null, "about, her son had been talking about her work in the laboratory and so": null, "we had-": null, "Thorn: I think Lukas only mentioned that she worked there. I don't": null, "think-": null, "Tula: And that's all that we talked about so I think she was just busy.": null, "But we were thinking about going for a walk aboveground in a little": null, "while. Something Lila felt like doing. I don't know if we feel like a": null, "little family stroll.": null, "Jasper: I think what's happening for Thorn right now is like, with": null, "smelling that, feeling like something is generally off, like, I'm trying": null, "to work out whether you're giving us a signal with this like, going for": null, "a walk thing.": null, "Jasper: And I don't know if that... Like, that's how Thorn's": null, "interpreting it.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Jasper: So like, if I can do an insight check to see if I can pick up": null, "what-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.": null, "Jasper: I think she's putting down.": null, "Brennan: You can tell Tula is not feeling like, bolting. That it's just": null, "a little bit of privacy, yeah.": null, "Jasper: Oh yeah, no, yeah, that's what I mean is more of a private like,": null, "we need to be somewhere private.": null, "Brennan: Just, let's be somewhere private.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.": null, "Rashawn: It would be nice to get some fresh air. We've been down here": null, "for a while.": null, "Brennan: Yeah.": null, "Izzy: Is there any way to like, find out if it feels like we're in any": null, "way being surveilled, like, in our room?": null, "Aabria: In this right now? What a fun question. Investigation check.": null, "[die taps table]": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Can I do...": null, "Aabria: You wanna do it too?": null, "Siobhan: Can I do a perception check for the same thing?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sure.": null, "Siobhan: Would it have to be also with investigation?": null, "Aabria: I think you are a vibe catcher, and you are specifically looking": null, "for stuff so.": null, "Siobhan: Great, I got an 18. No, 19.": null, "Aabria: Okay, 19 and 14. I think you looking around, you're just looking": null, "for like, weak points. Also, you guys are very good at like, being": null, "conspiratorial and being like, here's how I know in my room how mom": null, "will, or especially Auntie Beatrix would overhear. You, sort of in your": null, "cursory glance, don't see anything that would give the game away within": null, "your like, little nest at all. But you are deeply aware of the fact that": null, "there's no fourth wall here. But with that, right now if you guys all": null, "got quiet, you would hear maybe the murmurings of the loudest people": null, "surrounding you if they were shouting, but you can't overhear anyone": null, "else's conversations.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Hm.": null, "Aabria: And I think with a perception check of 19, you see that people": null, "would have to, like, expend a pretty aggressive amount, like a nigh": null, "noticeable amount of energy trying to listen in. Like, it would be like": null, "seeing a little ear [laughs] or like a bit of fur like someone-": null, "Siobhan: Great, they haven't figured out the glass against the wall": null, "trick yet.": null, "Aabria: Exactly, how could you get a bit of glass that small? Where": null, "would that even come from? A Polly in my pocket?": null, "Siobhan: Yes, exactly.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Do you think they have that?": null, "Siobhan: Exactly.": null, "Jasper: No, Aabria, no.": null, "Siobhan: Thank you, thank you.": null, "Aabria: [laughs] So yeah, but you are realizing like, kind of looking": null, "out and away, the thing they can do is keep track of you.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: Not necessarily like, listen in on you.": null, "Thorn: Can I just say, uh, Ava, I was wondering if perhaps it would be a": null, "good idea to have a little morning clean. Just, you know, a little bit": null, "of grooming of each other, just-": null, "Viola: You wanna be licked by my mother? [Aabria laughs]": null, "Ava: I thought you'd never ask!": null, "Tula: You've done it now.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Wild!": null, "Viola: Wow. [Erika gurgles and sticks out her tongue]": null, "Lila: What the fuck is wrong with you?": null, "Thorn:\u00a0And that's all of us.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Yeah, absolutely.": null, "Thorn: That's all of us.": null, "Erika: Yeah. [laughs]": null, "Rashawn: Well, wait, 'cause it's my sister I can sense vibes.": null, "Viola: Was that Meredith giving you shit?": null, "Tula: She...": null, "Brennan: And I don't know how people can hear us or not. And I was like,": null, "Tula: You know what? I thought she was just as lovely as could be.": null, "[Aabria laughs]": null, "Viola: Hm, bless her heart.": null, "Tula: Bless her heart.": null, "Note: \u201cbless their heart\u201d is a very specific Southern US way of talking": null, "smack about someone who is not present": null, "Viola:\u00a0Mm. [players laughing]": null, "Aabria: If you like her, I love her. [cast laughing at the Southern": null, "shade]": null, "Rashawn: Okay, I don't know... Have you told us that you saw people": null, "seeing you? Do you think you-": null, "Aabria: That has not happened yet.": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0That has not-": null, "Erika: Now-": null, "Izzy: I think we're like, a little trying to like, leave.": null, "Erika: Yeah, a little trying to leave, and we're on the go. We're doing": null, "a little spit wash on the go. And I'm saying, now,": null, "Ava: I don't mean to tell tales out of Education, but I met one of the": null, "First Stoats and-": null, "Tula: What? [player gasps]": null, "Ava:\u00a0Their, his-": null, "Ava:\u00a0Their teeth-": null, "Viola: What?": null, "Ava: [disgusted] Were just, oh! Oh! [Siobhan laughing]": null, "Viola: I mean, if your teeth are the first to go, you're basically": null, "falling apart.": null, "Ava: No! I mean, they were just odd, you know? I mean, and not, you": null, "know, just...": null, "Tula: You met one of the First Stoats?": null, "Ava: Yes! And they're very handsome. But still, their teeth are, it's": null, "like a wolf's in the front but like a...": null, "Lila: Pig?": null, "Ava: No, no, no, the...": null, "Viola: Deer?": null, "Jaysohn: Beaver.": null, "Viola: Turtle.": null, "Aabria: That's all the animals.": null, "Lila: Fish.": null, "Ava: The ones that have... Yeah, the mice, I think, in the back.": null, "Jaysohn: Sabre-toothed mice.": null, "Ava: You know how in the back? They have in the back and they're all": null, "flat. They're all flat in the back.": null, "Tula: They have flat teeth in the back?": null, "Aabria: Hold on, hold on. This is a stupid opportunity to make Erika,": null, "try to make Erika's character know more. Make a wisdom saving throw.": null, "Jasper: Heck yeah.": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0Do they eat meat or...": null, "Erika: That's a three. [players laughing]": null, "Aabria: You've never known what a back flat tooth is called.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Learn.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Learn.": null, "Erika: Let me be very clear, I eat my rodents whole just all the way": null, "through.": null, "Aabria: Ava is perfect-": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Gotta swallow.": null, "Erika: And makes me feel insane. [Erika chomping]": null, "Erika: And they're just flat in the back and pointy in the front.": null, "Rashawn: Are we outside? Have we made our way out?": null, "Jasper:\u00a0I think-": null, "Aabria: I mean, you're still in it unless you were making like, big": null, "clips up.": null, "Izzy: Do I get the vibe that Sybil might know Thieves' Cant? [Siobhan": null, "gasps]": null, "Aabria: Ah, so now we're in a very interesting thing with... I know that": null, "this is your like, rogue kit.": null, "Izzy: Yes. If I were to put like, secret mess... If I tried to write for": null, "the first time [Izzy and Siobhan laughing] and put secret messages in": null, "it.": null, "Izzy: One, would I be able to do that?": null, "Aabria: Super fun fact, how would you know? You don't know what a rogue": null, "is. And you didn't meet her through a connection where you'd be like, we": null, "have the same ability set.": null, "Izzy: 1,000 percent": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So what I'm gonna tell you is-": null, "Izzy: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: You can always try and see what happens.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, I think I wanna try and like, get a message to Sybil.": null, "Aabria: Sure. While the adults are talking.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: What does Lila do?": null, "Izzy: Well, she's like... [laughs] Okay, fuck. Do I...": null, "Aabria: Oh, you pulled focus. Bitch, you better be ready!": null, "Izzy: Well, I tried to pass you a note, but then you asked. Do I need to": null, "think about pencils?": null, "Aabria: Oh, we can make it very easy.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Okay, okay, okay.": null, "Aabria: And say that you've got like animal blood or stuff.": null, "Izzy: And thank God, thank God.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, you're good.": null, "Izzy: Okay, I think I'm just trying to be like, how can we help?": null, "Aabria: Okay, so you're trying to encode the idea, how can we help?": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: In the general like, help you? Help the thing? Help what?": null, "Izzy: She wept to us yesterday.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sure, sure, sure.": null, "Izzy: And said, \"Help me.\"": null, "Aabria: Is that what she said?": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria: Interesting. Yeah, no. Okay, why don't you ponder how you wanna": null, "like, execute on this, and then we'll like, wrap this little bit up and": null, "we'll come on back to you.": null, "Aabria: Cool, sweet.": null, "Thorn: Jaysohn, did you notice anyone paying any particular attention to": null, "us right now here just before we leave?": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, no, yeah. In the line, the ones with the copper.": null, "Thorn: Right now, like in this moment.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Oh, right now. Oh, I know-": null, "Thorn: In our little cubby.": null, "Siobhan: Can I do a perception check?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You already did one.": null, "Siobhan: Oh yeah, no, no. Oh no.": null, "Aabria: When you looked out, when you looked out, you saw like,": null, "Population Support.": null, "Aabria: They're moving through.": null, "Siobhan: They're moving through, but they're not like...": null, "Jasper: In this moment whilst we're here.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Obviously, yeah.": null, "Aabria: There is no one in proximity to you listening for you.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Great.": null, "Aabria: But looking out into the corridor.": null, "Siobhan: There's like, maybe somebody hanging out. Like just-": null, "Aabria: There's always someone close, and they're looking up.": null, "Aabria: At the wall of nests.": null, "Ava: You mean to say that we're new here and nobody's paying attention": null, "to us?": null, "Tula: I think a lot of people are paying attention to us, Mama. Maybe": null, "too many.": null, "Jasper: I'm just gonna like, sort of position my back so that I'm sort": null, "of talking to the family with my back to the open entrance. And I'm just": null, "gonna say,": null, "Thorn: I believe that you're being tracked. I smelled something as you": null, "came in, and I fear that if we suddenly all leave and go for a walk": null, "without any particular direction, that's asking for people to follow us.": null, "If they're not in this moment tracking us, perhaps this is perhaps the": null, "best place to have an open conversation as swiftly as we can before we": null, "decide what we want to do so we need to be quick, efficient, but I think": null, "that if we leave, we're going to encourage them to suspect something. We": null, "don't want to let them know that we understand that... And I'll sort of": null, "gesture to like, can you smell? [sniffs]": null, "Brennan: Do I start to smell it once he points it out to me.": null, "Aabria: You know what, I'm not even gonna make you roll for it. Yeah,": null, "now that you're sort of pointing out like, something smells weird. And": null, "because you had been carrying all the food back.": null, "Izzy: It's Tula's toots.": null, "Aabria: You were sort of like, it's not my toots, what could it be? Now": null, "that you've put down all the food-": null, "Brennan: If you're telling me that I fart. Yeah, um... [cast laughing]": null, "Jasper: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.": null, "Aabria: Now that food is down and distributed, you no longer have the": null, "scent of that in your nose and you're like, oh, there is just a little": null, "something tangy lingering in the air, and you recognize it as like,": null, "yeah.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Musk.": null, "Aabria: There's musk.": null, "Brennan: Who did I make physical contact with, with me and my kids?": null, "Aabria: As you were coming back, I think it's very much like, there is": null, "enough people out, especially when you were in that cramped line, that": null, "like you were coming in, people were going like, \"Oh, excuse me, pardon": null, "me,\" and brushing past you. Someone brushed past you and marked you.": null, "Brennan: Does this feel like an... Like, when I smell this, does it": null, "smell like the smell of the stoats of this warren? Like, it's naturally": null, "rubbing off on me?": null, "Brennan: Or does it feel more specific?": null, "Aabria: You guys don't... Other than like, Tula's unfortunate problem": null, "with crop dusting... [laughs]": null, "Bren: You have a litter of kits and see how hard it is to keep it locked": null, "up down there!": null, "Siobhan: [to camera]\u00a0My mom is a farty little slut. [cast laughing]": null, "Brennan: Okay? Like, do like the classic 1950s like, her in a cartoon in": null, "a circle. \"Farty Little Slut\" in big block letters. [Siobhan poses]": null, "Rashawn: I'm a farty little slut.": null, "Aabria: 100 percent! But you-": null, "Jasper: I'm a tooty little girl.": null, "Aabria: You understand that like, musking and marking and all of that": null, "scent work is intentional. Like, no one does that on accident.": null, "Aabria: So you were very clearly marked, and now it makes sense that": null, "like-": null, "Brennan:\u00a0So-": null, "Aabria: Now that your son was like, \"Yeah, people are watching.\"": null, "Brennan: We've been marked, and I think I'm trying to ascertain if it's": null, "like, is this like, oh, this is like the pollen ambient in the air or is": null, "this like a royal jelly? Like, we put the criminal stank on you kind of": null, "vibe?": null, "Brennan: It's less of like, criminal stank. 'Cause it's not like, yeah,": null, "this isn't like being marked by a bee and it's like, if you smell this,": null, "attack them.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Wild.": null, "Brennan: So like, if we took a bath we'd be fine to move or-": null, "Siobhan: Right, but maybe they would be like, why did they take a bath?": null, "Aabria: You know that you smell different than the other stoats in the": null, "warren. And this is less of like, you've been marked for something to": null, "happen and more of like, I think your natural paranoia in this is like,": null, "how do you keep track of someone? Population Support understands that": null, "like, once a flag's been raised, once you've been marked, everyone": null, "knows, if I smell something, keep an eye on them.": null, "Erika mimes energetically licking Jasper with a very intense expression.": null, "Thorn: We used to, when finding a new rabbit warren... Thank you. We": null, "would mark one-": null, "Aabria: [laughs] Sorry. The look on their face got me.": null, "Thorn: One particular rabbit, we would mark it. It would make it easier": null, "for us to follow them and then... [Erika licks dryly] Oh! And they would": null, "lead us then back their warren. It's a similar smell, and it's very": null, "intentional. [Erika gurgles] Oh, God! Okay, it's less actually... I've": null, "kind of revealed the thing now, the MacGuffin. It's more them that need": null, "the...": null, "Tula: We shouldn't remove this unless we're planning to bolt.": null, "Tula: For the wood line right now. It's more suspicious for them to find": null, "us and if we don't smell that way again.": null, "Tula: That's the most suspicious. So, if we want to bolt right now,": null, "let's get rid of it. And if we're not going to bolt right now, then we": null, "should just remember that anything sneaky we wanna do in the future, we": null, "should cover ourselves with a more powerful scent.": null, "Ava: If we do want to bolt, though I highly recommending taking Truck.": null, "Tula: I wonder if we could go find that...": null, "Ava: Hm?": null, "Thorn: Hm?": null, "Viola: Did you learn how to...": null, "Ava: Oh, I didn't. I don't know how to...": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Truck.": null, "Ava: Truck yet, but they're working on how to Truck Truck.": null, "Lila: Where?": null, "Ava: The twins showed me.": null, "Lila: Who's that?": null, "Ava: They're the head of Defense.": null, "Tula: Ooh, Defense. Boo, boring.": null, "Siobhan: Ooh, can we meet them? [cast laughing]": null, "Aabria: Really quick, Lila. So, do you have like, your sort of coded": null, "message?": null, "Izzy: Well, I was gonna go see if I could maybe just like, see if she's": null, "in her place.": null, "Aabria: Oh yeah. Do you wanna just go talk to her?": null, "Aabria: Sure, sure, sure.": null, "Tula: Okay, all right, sweetie. We'll see you. Wait, I don't, I": null, "actually-": null, "Lila: I think I'll just talk to Sybil.": null, "Jaysohn: I wanna talk to Sybil. Can I talk to Sybil?": null, "Lila: Okay, yeah, come. And Mom.": null, "Ava: Oh, Lila's going to see her little girlfriend.": null, "Lila: And Mom. [Jasper chuckles]": null, "Tula: Me? I don't wanna see... Well, okay. [laughs] I'm like, I'm gonna": null, "stay here and talk with the family. You go talk to Sybil, sweetie.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: Sweet. All right, Jaysohn and Lila. You make your way up and": null, "over. And it's quite easy to like, do kind of like a look up, peek in,": null, "that's not it, that's not it. And you see Sybil just sort of just kinda": null, "waking up. You know, late teenager. They get up at the crack of noon if": null, "left to their own devices, like,": null, "Sybil: uh, what?": null, "Sybil: [yawns] Hi, good morning.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Good morning.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Hi.": null, "Jaysohn: Do you wanna go outside with us?": null, "Sybil: Why? No.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0I just wanna find all the rocks.": null, "Sybil: This is my day off.": null, "Lila: I think we should stay right here.": null, "Jaysohn: What? No, we were gonna go outside.": null, "Lila: Jaysohn, literally, did you hear everything-": null, "Jayson:\u00a0I just wanna-": null, "Lila: That they were just talking about in our room?": null, "Sybil: You have something in your room?": null, "Lila: Sybil, hi.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Hi, good morning.": null, "Lila: Good morning. Remember-": null, "Sybil: [yawning]\u00a0Hey, let's talk on the nest.": null, "Lila: Do you remember everything-": null, "Aabria: And she just rolls over. She does not get up.": null, "Lila: Do you, do you, ssh, ssh, ssh, it's okay.": null, "Aabria: [laughs and claps] It's so soothing.": null, "Lila: Sybil, do you remember everything you showed us yesterday?": null, "Sybil: Oh.": null, "Aabria: And she immediately is fully awake.": null, "Sybil: Yes...": null, "Lila: My family's being followed.": null, "Sybil: Why?": null, "Lila: Because I think we broke a lot of rules and asked too many": null, "questions.": null, "Jaysohn: And we gave Lukas mint.": null, "Sybil: Okay, hold on, real quick. Who were you asking questions of?": null, "'Cause I did say, don't say anything.": null, "Lila: I didn't. [Brennan chortles]": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Didn't what? [Siobhan laughs]": null, "Lila: I didn't say anything.": null, "Jaysohn: We were so quiet.": null, "Sybil: So when you say asking questions, who was asking questions?": null, "Jaysohn: We got in trouble for nothing. We were being so good.": null, "Lila: We talked to a lady who worked in the lab.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, Lukas's mom.": null, "Sybil: Just in general? And did you ask her questions?": null, "Jaysohn and Lila: [in unison] Yes/No!": null, "Sybil: Yeah, don't lie to me. You came here. You came to me.": null, "Lila:\u00a0I did not.": null, "Sybil: I was asleep. It's my day off.": null, "Lila: I know.": null, "Sybil: My ribs were broken. My brother's dead!": null, "Lila: I know, I'm so sorry.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Yeah!": null, "Lila: Dead, dead, dead, he's dead.": null, "Sybil: Yeah, it's bad!": null, "Lila:\u00a0Yeah, I know.": null, "Sybil: Thank you for telling me the truth immediately. That's good.": null, "Lila: Yeah, but I'm just trying to sort of figure out what to do": null, "because... [blows softly]": null, "Sybil: Yes. Oh, thank you. Honestly, kinda nice. Oh, you smell a": null, "little... [sniffs]": null, "Lila: We got peed on, yeah.": null, "Sybil: Oh, there's...": null, "Lila: They're just tracking us. They're tracking us.": null, "Sybil: Yeah.": null, "Jaysohn: Wait, do you know who it is? Can you smell who it is? Do you": null, "know?": null, "Sybil: Oh, this is Population Support. They help, but they are": null, "population control.": null, "Lila: Do you think we should clean ourselves?": null, "Sybil: I think it would make sense that... Of course, why wouldn't kids": null, "be cleaned?": null, "Lila: Yeah, that's what I thought.": null, "Sybil: So you would forget. Yeah, and get it off of you.": null, "Lila: But my mom thought it was suspicious.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, but I do hate-": null, "Sybil: And that way you have deniability for why it's gone.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Okay, but wait, so whenever-": null, "Sybil: And then new Population Support-": null, "Lila:\u00a0It has to fucking go away.": null, "Sybil: The other coppers won't be able to know who you are.": null, "Lila: Yeah, yeah, ACAB.": null, "Aabria makes finger guns to the camera as the cast realizes the \u201ccopper": null, "(metal) ": "copper (police) pun.", "Aabria: Yeah, she said copper wires several times.": null, "Rashawn: It was right in front of our faces.": null, "Lila: Okay, I also just wanna know, what do you think we should do?": null, "[Rashawn exhales sharply] [Jasper chuckles] Because you asked us for": null, "help yesterday.": null, "Lila: I don't know. I don't know what to do. [laughs]": null, "Sybil: No, you're good. And thank you for coming in. And I'm so sorry if": null, "your family's in danger because of the thing.": null, "Lila: Well, and you know, it's like, our fault.": null, "Sybil: Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. Just rule one, and please take this in": null, "the spirit in which it's intended. Stop fucking talking to other people": null, "about the scary stuff.": null, "Lila: Yeah, for sure.": null, "Sybil: I've been here my whole life, and every time I've asked a": null, "question... I was like you not that long ago 'cause I'm not that much": null, "older than you. Like, weeks ago asked questions and was marked and": null, "watched Like, weeks ago asked questions and was marked and watched until": null, "I just went with the flow for a while so-": null, "Lila: Oh.": null, "Sybil: I'm sorry I didn't say that earlier. I kind of assumed, like, you": null, "seem to have your shit together.": null, "Lila: No, we're smart but we're dumb.": null, "Sybil: No, it's okay, it's okay. You're great and you're so smart.": null, "You're both so good.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, we do not know how this warren works at all.": null, "Sybil: You're good. Here, come here.": null, "Aabria: And she's just gonna reach out and grab you both and pull you a": null, "little more into the nest just getting low.": null, "Sybil: I'm not paranoid. I'm worried.": null, "Jaysohn: No, we don't think you're paranoid.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Cool, thank you.": null, "Jaysohn: We think you're awesome.": null, "Lila: Those might be the same thing, but for sure.": null, "Sybil: Fair, thank you. We gotta find the Reactor. I don't think there's": null, "anyone we can ask questions to that are gonna give us answers.": null, "Lila: My grandma met a First Stoat.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, and she said his teeth were really weird.": null, "Sybil: Which one?": null, "Jaysohn: Oh, Cankle?": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Do I know? [Rashawn chortles]": null, "Sybil: Kiran.": null, "Lila: Mm, yeah.": null, "Sybil: The dictator?": null, "Jasper: [whisper] The dictator?": null, "Lila:\u00a0The dictator?": null, "Jayasohn: The dictator?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Ooh!": null, "Izzy: The dictator?": null, "Aabria: Yeah. Oh, that's so interesting. Insight check. [laughs] That's": null, "interesting and normal. Both of you, come on.": null, "Izzy: 17.": null, "Siobhan: 19.": null, "Aabria: [wheezes] Oh my God! Yeah, yeah, she's just immediately like, oh": null, "fucking no. Even along with that, like, a word you've never heard before": null, "but the context in which you got a reaction and then the sort of": null, "understanding that comes with it is control.": null, "Siobhan: Yes.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, and she saw Truck. [dramatic menacing music]": null, "Siobhan It just doesn't get the same reaction?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Siobhan: Interesting.": null, "Aabria: No, no, no.": null, "Siobhan: 'Cause to Jaysohn, Truck, very scary.

And you": null, "guys have weirdly more broad knowledge about stuff. And you guys have": null, "weirdly more broad knowledge about stuff. Like, she can go deeper on": null, "some things, but you've heard a lot in the last 19 hours.": null, "Sybil: Uh, okay. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Wait, okay, rule one. We don't ask": null, "anyone that we're not sure are our friends anything!": null, "Jaysohn: And that's different from the other rule one that you already": null, "gave us?": null, "Sybil:\u00a0No.": null, "Lila: No, she's just saying it, sort of saying it again.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Sybil: Yeah, I'm just, rule one, rule two, same rule.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay.

Hold on.": null, "Lila: Okay.": null, "Aabria: And you see and she actually like, goes deeper into the nest and": null, "pulls out like, a scrap of paper and has drawn a rudimentary map a scrap": null, "of paper and has drawn a rudimentary map of this place and a couple X's": null, "where... She's like,": null, "Sybil: these are places it's very hard to get to.": null, "Sybil: And places that um, I feel pulled to.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Hm.": null, "Sybil: So it's interesting that a place where my body says it wants to": null, "go is hard to get to, you know?": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Does that make sense?": null, "Sybil: Like, the Light is like, yeah, that way. And then everything here": null, "is like, fuck that shit.": null, "Jaysohn: But it said the thing that we're supposed to go to the Light": null, "that Lila read.": null, "Sybil: You read a thing? [gasps] When you were on your way.": null, "Sybil: Right. We leave messages so stoats that are running from the": null, "humans or whatever problem they have know that they can keep going and": null, "it's like a hope thing, like hey-": null, "Jaysohn: But it's like saying you should do it and then it's saying you": null, "shouldn't do it.": null, "Sybil: Yeah, it's a little, yes, yeah, it's fucked up.": null, "Jaysohn: Well, I don't understand that at all.": null, "Sybil: No, I think you do.": null, "Jaysohn: No.": null, "Sybil: I think you understand that, and then the thing you do with that": null, "is not really coming to you, you know what I mean?": null, "Jayson:\u00a0Sure.": null, "Sybil: Like, you get it.

That's what I don't understand. That seems": null, "stupid to me. You just tell people one thing and then they should do the": null, "thing. Or they shouldn't, but then they're breaking the rules and then": null, "they can get in trouble.": null, "Sybil: Well, I mean, your mom tells you to do stuff that you don't wanna": null, "do, but you know you're good at doing, right?": null, "Jayson: Yeah.": null, "Sybil: All the time.

Like, what if we said to our mom we were going": null, "to Education but then, oops!": null, "Sybil: I think maybe this is a little more dangerous than just the three": null, "of us going.

I-": null, "Teedles: Lila.": null, "Thorn: most certainly.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0Sure.": null, "Thorn: And I was wondering if perhaps you had picked or if you had": null, "offered yourselves for a job yet.

And it wouldn't be the worst idea for us to have someone": null, "on the inside.": null, "Teedles: Done.": null, "Thorn: But no risks. Don't... The last thing I need is for either of you": null, "to be in any trouble. I'm just, I think that if we're going to find out": null, "some information, it would be helpful. Thank you.": null, "Teedles: Done, okay?": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Okay, yeah. You...": null, "Teedles: Keep them safe.": null, "Thorn: I will. And...": null, "Teedles: I would hug you, but I feel like it's weird.": null, "Thorn: I truly don't want to, yeah.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0Yeah, yeah. It's weird.": null, "Thorn: Yeah, yeah, the smell is...": null, "Teedles:\u00a0But there's like a-": null, "Teedles: Yeah, nothing. You're good.": null, "Thorn: Okay, as you...

[cast continues laughing]": null, "Brennan: Got 'em. [Izzy grimaces]": null, "Aabria: Got 'em. [laughs] And you go ahead and make your way back. So": null, "what's the game plan, fam?": null, "Ava: Well, I suppose that we should go meet Charlie, yes.": null, "Thorn: Mm, okay, but let's just have it a tiny bit quieter. Just like a": null, "tiny bit.": null, "Tula: Sybil said that it would be best to be clean. It would be best to": null, "not have this. All right, well then yeah, let's do that.": null, "Lila: Didn't we already do that?": null, "Tula: To Jaysohn, yeah.": null, "Viola: But you haven't gotten yours.

It's just, it's so much faster and nicer when you have": null, "saliva.": null, "Rashawn: And your fur- [cast laughing]": null, "Aabria: The dry grandma.": null, "Rashawn: Kinda part- Not a middle part, but just to the sides.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0This episode is fucked up. [Siobhan laughs]": null, "Erika: So, um, yeah, and that... And as I'm licking Viola I'm,": null, "Ava: And that \u201cKaren\u201d lied directly to my face. I mean, I asked, you": null, "know, \"Have you ever had an altercation with a human?\" And they were": null, "like, \"No.\" And absolutely they have. Pushed 'em back, I'd say.": null, "Thorn: As in, they've, altercation with the humans here?": null, "Ava: Oh, I don't know if it was here here, but I, you know, they've": null, "been... The twins say that they've been sort of going out further and": null, "that the humans have been coming through and all. And I asked them, do": null, "you plan to go to human burrows And I asked them, do you plan to go to": null, "human burrows and wipe them out, you know, just the way that your father": null, "and I did many years ago? The Blue Warren is no more. Well, you go to": null, "their warren and then you get rid of them-": null, "Lil: You killed people?": null, "Ava:\u00a0What? No.": null, "Tula: Stoats, darling. Stoats.": null, "Lil:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Ava: Stoats, yes, and so they, yes, indeed, I think they're putting": null, "together some plans for being able to go to human burrows and make sure": null, "that they don't come back here anymore.": null, "Lila: Grandma, you got so much intel. I'm so impressed.": null, "Ava: Oh, thank you, dear. It's not bad for someone who doesn't know how": null, "to read or pre-read.": null, "Lila: Sure.": null, "Brennan: Pre-read? Oh, write. [cast laughing] [Aabria clapping] And I'm": null, "going to... I'm gonna look at Thorn and Viola and say,": null, "Tula: Whatever is or is not true about the Blue, here they are in": null, "control of everything, and we know that they are lying. So this place is": null, "not safe. I think we should go... I can't believe I'm saying this. I": null, "think we should go to this Reactor.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Oh, I've been waiting for you-": null, "Viola: To get on board, Tula!": null, "Izzy pretends to undergo a spiritual experience.": null, "Tula: Lila! Look at me! [Aabria screams excitedly]": null, "Thorn: I just say to everyone, nobody argue.

You": null, "were able to map it easily. This one is someone who hasn't really had-": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Secondhand.": null, "Aabria: Like an eagle-eyed view. Yeah, exactly, trying to explain": null, "distance. Like, it's a real zoomed-out cartography, and she might not": null, "have done that good a job. How'd you do?": null, "Izzy: Critical... Success.": null, "Aabria: Okay. [warm tones resound] [players cheering] It coulda gone a": null, "different way.": null, "Rashawn: My heart.": null, "Izzy: For a 29.": null, "Aabria: Amazing!": null, "Brennan: You don't say.

I don't understand!": null, "Lila: [tearfully] And so are you, Mommy! You wanna go and you wanna find": null, "the crazy thing.": null, "Tula: I wanna do it 'cause I think it's gonna expedite us leaving, but I": null, "love you. [cast laughing]": null, "Erika hands Izzy a hard candy. Izzy holds it up in triumph.": null, "Aabria: You understand expedite immediately. And there was a lot to this": null, "because there were multiple X's where there were a couple points of": null, "like, this might be it, this might be it, this might be it. And I think": null, "as you, like, deftly navigate through the halls of Last Bast, you get": null, "closer. I wanna honor that crit because I was going to make you check": null, "each reactor to try to find Charlie.": null, "Aabria: But I think the second one you go to as you're like, okay, this": null, "might be one. How could you tell? Let's go check the other. And as you": null, "were like, well, maybe we go down this. Something inside you is like,": null, "no, the thing you feel isn't strong enough.": null, "Izzy: Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And as you like, go and-": null, "Izzy: Yeah, Sybil said it was like...

Please don't put this on me.": null, "Erika: I don't think that we need to move quickly, you know. It's not": null, "like we're on some sort of a crunch here.

[laughs] I got a 19.": null, "Aabria: Do you wanna use any of the inspiration that's been thrown your": null, "way?": null, "Siobhan: I absolutely do. I absolutely do. Okay, that's a 27.": null, "Aabria: There you go.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0There we go.": null, "Rashawn: I got a 18.": null, "Aabria: Lila is focused and locked in, but you have to give her like,": null, "we're running through the halls or we're trying to find a secret": null, "passage, and that's the question I need answered from you now.": null, "Siobhan: Oh.": null, "Rashawn: Finding the secret passage.": null, "Brennan: Secret, yeah.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, I'm gonna say secret just 'cause we had success with the": null, "secret passage yesterday, right?": null, "Brennan: I think the threat, right, if we're gone for longer they know": null, "that we're not in our home and they raise a high alert, right?": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Right.": null, "Brennan: So if we're sprinting through the hallways, it's like-": null, "Siobhan: That's also weird.": null, "Brennan: It's also weird. I think it's one of those things where-": null, "Aabria: Make it weird.": null, "Brennan: Pick our poison.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah.": null, "Brennan: I'd rather explain why they couldn't find us than get caught": null, "going to the big, secret place.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Yeah, yeah.": null, "Jasper: Hell yeah, okay.": null, "Aabria: And with that note, [to Siobhan] give me a survival check. [die": null, "Siobhan: Okay. [laughs] There it is. That is a 27.": null, "Jasper: Whoo!": null, "Aabria: Amazing, as you are sort of given the notes as everyone's like,": null, "okay, we have to find a way to like, not be seen and make our way": null, "through so Lila can navigate us there. You, whose head is always up": null, "looking for a more interesting thing than whatever the fuck's happening": null, "in front of you have clocked big vents and pipes everywhere. [Siobhan": null, "whips her head around] And you think that like, if you lead them through": null, "the ventilation system.": null, "Aabria: Where you do not see stoats running, you can get them there out": null, "of sight. And with a 27, you absolutely do it. I don't even have a": null, "navigational thing to give. Like, you do it. You're great.": null, "Jaysohn: Mom, it's like what Sybil did with us yesterday.": null, "Tula: Oh! Up through here?": null, "Tula: It doesn't smell like anything even comes up through here.": null, "Tula: Well, great job, sweetie. You are both doing so good. I'm so proud": null, "of you. [tearfully] And it's just such little time until you're grown": null, "up. You're almost there. I love you so much.": null, "Izzy and Siobhan wiggle their fingers and touch hands across the table.": null, "Jaysohn: No, no, no, we're already really grown up and we're doing": null, "grown-up jobs.": null, "Jaysohn: And we don't have to go to Education. Let's go! [cast": null, "chuckling] [Brennan sighs in exasperation]": null, "Ava: What would they learn there anyway that they can't learn with their": null, "grandmother?": null, "Jaysohn: Exactly. Grandma teaches us so much.": null, "Tula: Well, I would normally say something sassy, but she interrogated": null, "the president? What happened? [cast laughing] I think she's right. I": null, "think it all, she's right.": null, "Viola: And she thinks she is the president.": null, "Brennan: There you go.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You make your way through-": null, "Tula: Wait, what did you talk to that dictator about? You didn't talk": null, "about anything inappropriate, did you?": null, "Ava: No.": null, "Aabria: Insight check! With advantage!": null, "Erika:\u00a0No!": null, "Aabria: Deception check!": null, "Rashawn: I'm gonna gang up on Mom, too.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Did you ask if this dictator was single?": null, "Brennan: That's gonna be a 28.": null, "Aabria: Oh, yeah.": null, "Erika: Well, that's a four. [players laughing] I 100 percent believe": null, "that I did not say anything out of the ordinary.": null, "Aabria: And you know what that means. [cast laughing]": null, "Ava: Not even a little bit, but that Bennett fellow was there. [cast": null, "chuckling]": null, "Tula: I cannot believe that you told an immortal dictator that your": null, "daughter was single. [cast laughing] All right.": null, "Ava: If I don't get it there, who will? [Brennan laughs]": null, "Aabria: [claps] Amazing. You make your way through this ventilation": null, "system, and you're able to make your way through pipes and tunnels and": null, "then you start getting to spaces and places where it's dusty and there": null, "are no longer stoat footprints. And you feel it, that's the thing that": null, "almost takes over from your mind mapping down the marks. You can let": null, "that light, that Blue lead you forward and down until you see letters": null, "sort of on the inside. Markings, the letter C over and over again for": null, "Charlie. You don't know. It doesn't matter. There's no need for a stoat": null, "to understand the NATO alphabet. And then you find it. Can I get my map?": null, "Wipe cut to the new map. It is a large, square stone floor resting above": null, "a pool of water and enclosed by circular walls of a rusted-out nuclear": null, "reactor. The floor is made up of eight smaller squares, each of which": null, "contains a portion of a symbol carved into the rock. Because one square": null, "is missing, from above, the floor resembles a sliding number puzzle. The": null, "symbol, though scrambled, is clearly the trefoil icon for nuclear power.": null, "The stoat models are arranged on the border of the floor next to the": null, "squares.": null, "Aabria: Okay, you all move down. You find a little hatch, open it up": null, "[players gasp] and push through.": null, "Aabria dramatically removes the high walls to reveal the puzzle to the": null, "cast.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Lines. [players screaming]": null, "Jasper:\u00a0What? [player gasps]": null, "Brennan: It's a straight-up puzzle! [Jasper gasps]": null, "Rashawn: It's a puzzle!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You see one stoat [player gasps] waiting on the edge.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Meredith.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[jokingly] It's absolutely Meredith.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0If it's Meredith, I'm gonna spec barbarian-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So here's what we're gonna do. You get absolutely rushed as you": null, "sort of spill through the hatch [hatch squeaking] into this room. And a": null, "singular stoat with the massive cattle prods that you saw earlier is": null, "going to run up and take an attack.": null, "Siobhan: [gasps] Auntie!": null, "Aabria: With a natural 20.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Aabria: Viola, you take 17 points of lightning damage, and I need": null, "everyone to roll initiative. [Erika groans]": null, "Jasper: Oh, this is so sick. [Aabria laughs]": null, "Brennan: 17.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0All right, 17.": null, "Siobhan: 23.": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn's got a 23. Viola.": null, "Rashawn: Eight.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Eight. Thorn.": null, "Jasper: [laughs] That is eight. [Aabria gasps in realization]": null, "Rashawn: Honey, oh my God.": null, "Jasper and Rashawn clasp hands as they share initiative order.": null, "Siobhan: Cute.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's so cute.": null, "Jasper: Terrifying.": null, "Aabria: Assumption that Thorn has the higher dex-": null, "Jasper:\u00a0I think I have the higher dex.": null, "Aabria: Between the two of you.": null, "Jasper: I've got a +3 for dex, yeah.": null, "Rashawn: +3.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Also three.": null, "Jasper: Oh my God!": null, "Aabria: Oh my God, Rollies! Roll again! [dice tap table]": null, "Rashawn: [to Jasper] You got it.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Right.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, okay. [laughs] Ava, how'd you do?": null, "Erika: Nine.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Nine.": null, "Izzy: 21.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Got a 21.": null, "Aabria: With a 23, Jaysohn, you're up.": null, "Siobhan: Okay, I am going to bonus action bring out my Arms of the": null, "Astral Self. They glow blue and give me a 10-foot range. And I am going": null, "to rush past this person who just zapped my favorite aunt, and I am": null, "going to try to knock them prone.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Oof.": null, "Siobhan: So first attack is a 17?": null, "Aabria: Misses.": null, "Jasper: Ooh.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0The second attack.": null, "Rashawn: Ooh.": null, "Siobhan: Oh, that's gotta hit. Is a 26.": null, "Aabria: Oh my God, yeah. Absolutely hits.": null, "Siobhan: Okay, I knock them to the floor.": null, "Aabria: You see this stoat like, sort of encumbered, manages to miss": null, "your first hit, but you're able to like, get in and under, and just the": null, "unwieldiness of the contraption on his back, he falls down and is prone.": null, "Siobhan: So now you all have advantage-": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Get his thing.": null, "Siobhan: On attacking him.": null, "Izzy: I will have advantage?": null, "Izzy: Oh cool, take his gun.": null, "Siobhan: Well, I used my bonus action. I don't... Can I take his gun?": null, "That seems like a... I don't have any other actions.": null, "Aabria: There are specific things in kits that allow you to like, remove": null, "weapons so yeah.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, but can I try and take his gun?": null, "Aabria: No. [chuckles]": null, "Izzy: I can.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah!": null, "Aabria: Sure. Go ahead.": null, "Izzy: Okay, I am going to sneak attack.": null, "Aabria: What are you attacking with? Are you getting in close?": null, "Izzy: Does that feel dumb?": null, "Aabria: The thing that is gonna be hard if you get in close is that": null, "you're gonna be in range of a lot of this stuff, and you don't know": null, "like, how quickly he's gonna move in initiative.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Uh-huh.": null, "Aabria: And you're by a big, terrifying pit.": null, "Izzy: So if I move in close...": null, "Aabria: You'll attack with advantage. If you stay far away, you'll be": null, "safer, but you will attack with disadvantage.": null, "Izzy: Okay, yeah, I will just... What's it called? Primal...": null, "Aabria: Primal Savagery.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Savagery.": null, "Aabria: Nice!": null, "Izzy: And try and take his thing.": null, "Aabria: So you're gonna aim to disarm him?": null, "Aabria: Okay. Make an attack roll.": null, "Izzy: 24.": null, "Aabria: A 24 hits. So, you see that this is like, strapped on and the": null, "main prod is in his hands.": null, "Aabria: So you cannot take this thing all the way off of him.": null, "Izzy: Okay.": null, "Aabria: But you can like, kick away the main prod in the front.": null, "Izzy: Okay, I'm going to do that.": null, "Izzy: 'Cause I think I'm scared of it. Can I kick it towards Jaysohn?": null, "Aabria: Sure. You come forward in here. Interpose yourself. [intense": null, "energetic music] And with him down on the ground, you're able to kick it": null, "and it slides back, still connected to his back and the backpack that": null, "he's wearing, and the prod itself is like, in front of Jaysohn now.": null, "Izzy: Okay, and then I'm gonna move back. [laughs]": null, "Aabria: If you move away and leave his threatened area, he's gonna get": null, "an opportunity attack on you.": null, "Siobhan: You could bonus action disengage.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, yeah. I'll do that.": null, "Aabria: Okay, so then you disengage. Where do you wanna get to? So": null, "you're able to use the rest of your movement to go somewhere else. Where": null, "are you trying to be?": null, "Izzy: I think just like, maybe behind Viola.": null, "Aabria: Okay, cool. And then you get in. You're able to, while he's": null, "down, kick the prod away and then sort of slither back under your aunt's": null, "legs. You just peek back, fuck off! [cast laughing] And he's still down.": null, "Beautiful.": null, "Rashawn: Good job, good job.": null, "Brennan: Good job, sweetie. Good job, sweetie.": null, "Aabria: A mild applause rings through this bizarre space, and everyone": null, "sees like, kind of as you look in and to the right, this massive pool.": null, "And it's almost distracting how enticing it is.": null, "The water of the pool that is visible in the open square of floor glows": null, "a scintillating, enticing Blue. Mysterious music plays.": null, "Like, being a kid going to a pool on the first day of summer you're": null, "like, nothing in this universe I want more than to jump into this. This": null, "is the closest you've ever been to a high concentration of what they": null, "call the Light and what you call Blue. [Jasper whistles dramatically]": null, "Next up, Tula. [stoat chittering]": null, "Brennan:\u00a0This person here with the cattle prod, he's been partially": null, "disarmed.": null, "Brennan: But not permanently. And coming in here, he just attacked my": null, "pregnant sister.": null, "Brennan: [flatly] Okay, I'm gonna kill him. [cast laughing] So...": null, "Aabria: You can absolutely get across. I kind of just put you in": null, "arbitrary spots.": null, "Brennan: No, for sure.": null, "Aabria: Don't worry about that initial distance.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna rush here, bonus action... Or actually, yeah, I'll": null, "just get to Tula's spot and like, put an arm in front of you, seeing": null, "you're injured.": null, "Aabria: Mom arm! [laughs]": null, "Brennan: Mom arm my sister.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna jump onto this tile here. [points to a square of": null, "floor next to the open pool]": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to attack this absolute jabroni [Siobhan and": null, "Aabria laughing] with advantage 'cause he's prone.": null, "Rashawn: Fuck 'em up.": null, "Brennan: Okay, that is a 12 on the first attack.": null, "Aabria: And then the next one's gonna be... That one's gonna be a 27.": null, "Aabria: Oh, jeez!": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, Mom!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It just hits!": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Jasper: Let's go, Tula.": null, "Brennan: Okay, and I'll go ahead-": null, "Rashawn: Toot toot.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And drop a-": null, "Jasper: Toot, toot!": null, "Brennan: I'll drop a smite on this one.": null, "Brennan: Just a first-level one. We'll go, so that's gonna be eight, 11,": null, "18, plus four. [Jasper grunts] 22 points of damage.": null, "The cast grins at the utter pwnage.": null, "Izzy: Just a first-level one, and he's actually expired.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Jesus Christ. [Brennan and Siobhan laugh]": null, "Jasper: Past tense.": null, "Aabria: Kind of a glass cannon. Yeah, just describe what you do to him.": null, "Shit.": null, "Siobhan: Wow, a one-hit wonder.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Okay, that was dope.": null, "Izzy: He's dead?": null, "Aabria: Fuck. Well, I did think this was gonna be more of a like, what's": null, "going on?": null, "Izzy: He attacked a pregnant woman.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I think this-": null, "Aabria: He doesn't know she's pregnant!": null, "Izzy: He has to die.": null, "Brennan: I think there's a... Again, I think that like, I... It's not": null, "reflected mechanically here. Tula has, if there was, like barbarians": null, "have rage. If she had a feature it would just be called fear.": null, "Aabria: Ooh.": null, "Brennan: And it would be... And so there's, she sees her sister being": null, "hurt. Is like, is immediately like, my sister, her children, their": null, "future, all of the happiness, everything coming to them. And if you": null, "like, caught it, those cameras where horses cross the finish line, the": null, "moment where the guy dies, [snaps fingers] I already just have my fangs": null, "deep in his trachea larynx tearing his throat out, and my eyes are wide": null, "in panic so I'm at my most afraid in the moment where I kill him.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oof! [viscera splashing] Oh, that's a cool description. Well,": null, "anyway, um-": null, "Jaysohn: Mom, can I have the weapon?": null, "Brennan mimes ripping and tearing wildly with his teeth. He snarls and": null, "gasps at Siobhan\u2019s voice before looking up at her.": null, "Viola: Whoa!": null, "Brennan: [breathless]\u00a0Yes, yeah, sweetie, if you want the weapon...": null, "Jaysohn: Oh!": null, "Ava: [to Tula] That-a girl!": null, "Erika: And clean up the\u2026 [they mime wiping goo with a thumb]": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Brennan wipes his mouth and pants.": null, "Tula: [frantic] Are you okay?": null, "Viola: I'm okay, I'm okay. Um, how are you?": null, "Tula: Fine. What an asshole!": null, "Viola: Where are we, Tula?": null, "Tula: I don't know.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna immediately just go to my sister and heal her for,": null, "how much damage did you take?": null, "Rashawn: 17.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Izzy: Oh my God.": null, "Aabria: Glass cannon. [laughs]": null, "Izzy: He's in hell.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, I've sent him straight to hell. We're gonna do Cure": null, "Wounds at first... That's 1d8, right? Or is that 2d8?": null, "Aabria: 1d8.": null, "Brennan:\u00a01d8. Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Aabria: 1d8 plus...": null, "Brennan: Plus spellcasting. So that's gonna be an eight. I heal eight": null, "hit points with the first one so you have, there's nine left, right?": null, "[energy powering up] Nine points of damage left. And I'll go ahead...": null, "I'm gonna do Lay on Hands for the rest. Let me get you back up to full.": null, "Rashawn: Oh, thank you.": null, "Brennan: You got it. I'm not gonna let my baby sister-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0HP back up.": null, "Brennan: Walk around here with kids on the way, injured! I don't fucking": null, "think so!": null, "Rashawn: It's just like when we were kids and people would try to funk": null, "with me. And my eyes close for like a second, and I thought it was 20": null, "years.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, I think there's a moment where I get my paw around you": null, "and it is like some other stoat in the Red Warren had like, pushed you": null, "down and I had thoroughly kicked his ass, but I did not tear a throat": null, "out, but...": null, "Viola: [tearfully] My sister's gonna fuck you up! [Brennan and Aabria": null, "Erika: Oh!": null, "Viola: Thank you, thank you.": null, "Tula: Sweetie, okay.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna ask a real morbid question.": null, "Siobhan: Do we eat stoat? [laughs]": null, "Aabria: If you wanna.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Well, uh... [clears throat]": null, "Jaysohn: Mom?": null, "Tula: Mm-hmm?": null, "Jaysohn: Do we eat stoat?": null, "Tula: You had rabbit earlier today.": null, "Jaysohn: Oh, but I'm real hungry.": null, "Viola: Sis, do not digest. They've been in this.": null, "Tula: I don't think it's safe. Your Auntie Vi is right, okay?": null, "Thorn: I have a suggestion, and I'd love it if-": null, "Lila: [singing]\u00a0But what happens if we go in the water?": null, "Thorn: This is, I have a suggestion that I truly-": null, "Lila: [singing] And Tula, oh my God\u2026": null, "Thorn: It doesn't sit well with me, but I'm just gonna say it anyway. Is": null, "there a universe in which it behooves us to throw the body into the, to": null, "see what happens.": null, "Lila: [singing] And see what happens\u2026 Does he come back to life?": null, "Thorn: Just so that we know. [Izzy and Aabria laughing]": null, "Aabria: The song is so pleasant and the concept is...": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Is horrific.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[singing] A nightmare!": null, "Tula: And Lila, if the man-": null, "Lila: [singing] And you get rid of the evidence!": null, "Tula:\u00a0Who just tried to kill your aunt-": null, "Lila: What?": null, "Tula: Came back to life, we would learn...": null, "Jaysohn: It's okay 'cause I have the thing.

Maybe it spins, I": null, "don't know what. But that little bit of pressure on the left side of it": null, "sends the entire thing slamming to the left and then it stops.

You feel magic hit [energy whooshes] and a pulse moves": null, "through [Erika gasps] and the entire pool flashes with Blue as the Bless": null, "lands. and the entire pool flashes with Blue as the Bless lands. You": null, "cast Bless also?": null, "Rashawn: Yes, on Thorn and my mother.": null, "Aabria: In that same way, you release energy, love, and hope and the": null, "desire for protection, and as you feel it sort of leave you with a": null, "prickling of your fur and the skin beneath, your eyes close but you're": null, "suddenly filled with light as again the pool underneath you flares.": null, "Thorn: Come back to me, sweetie.

[warm": null, "tones resound]": null, "Rashawn: Sure. Yeah, I only used two, so yes. I'm gonna include you in": null, "that as well. 'Cause in my, what I'm believing now is that maybe when we": null, "use this power, it's pulsating so could that shift these tiles?": null, "Jasper: Well, I think the tiles are shifting 'cause Lila pressed": null, "something.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Yeah, this moved, right?": null, "Aabria: Hold on, give me an arcana check with advantage.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Oh, does that actually\u2026": null, "Siobhan reaches to adjust the map.": null, "Aabria: What you doing, buddy?": null, "Siobhan: Did we move this one already?": null, "Aabria: She was standing on the left of it.

[Brennan laughs approvingly] I think you like,": null, "missed... Like, again, you're also very short and like, trying to look": null, "out at a thing that's very wide.": null, "Aabria: But once you've spent a little time investigating you're like,": null, "oh, at the very least this is a circle.": null, "Rashawn:\u00a0I guess-": null, "Aabria: So, what do you do? First things first, what do you do?": null, "Rashawn: Viola would move to the spot across from sis and try to pull...": null, "Aabria: Which one?
