That then the rug pull, the actual, that": null, "wands are actually, there was like a mind goes out of the back of my": null, "head. When you pulled out, like in the velvet bag and that appeared, it": null, "was crazy. That was crazy, that was crazy.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That was my favorite part from the first episode. So we were": null, "like, oh, it'll be really funny. Like they come out with the wand and": null, "then they'll all be disappointed 'cause they're boring but everyone was": null, "just so excited, like a prop. I was like, mm, all right.": null, "Erika:\u00a0That the thing is that at the table, you know, sometimes you do": null, "props. It's not necessarily a common thing at a tabletop game because": null, "you know, it's like, that's for LARP kids, you know? But you know, when": null, "a prop does happen, it's like, oh, we get little actual golden coins,": null, "you know? It's like theater of the mind is great, but holding something": null, "in your hand is even better.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I love it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I have a quick, oh god.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Oh sorry, no, no. I was literally just going to say that like,": null, "yeah, it was very much the like avocado kid from that one vine where": null, "he's like, an avocado thanks, where's he's like, he doesn't think an": null, "avocado is the coolest thing in the world, but he's like, listen, my": null, "choice was one avocado or no avocados, I'm not gonna shit on an avocado.": null, "It's more avocados than I had two seconds ago, like it's great.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, yeah, all right, I have a question. What houses do you": null, "think you would have been sorted into? Since we kind of did the rug pull": null, "like F it, you're all in Chimeron and it's also a pop quiz to see if": null, "y'all remember the names of the houses 'cause that's what happened to me": null, "last night. I got woken up like every two hours, I'd be like, do you": null, "remember everything you said, 'cause you made up a lot of shit.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Hercinil.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yep.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It's Aqrabus or Arqbus?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Aqrabus": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Aqrabus, Chimeron is the one that we're in and then, oh my god,": null, "I knew it and then the term Monsanto came into my head.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I had to constantly look down at my notes 'cause I was in my head,": null, "I would be like, yeah, Monsanto. and it's like, no it's not.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And then you're like Montero and like no, Lil Nas X. No, no,": null, "no.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Messanteu.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Messanteu.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I'll give you full credit.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Thank you.": null, "Lou:\u00a0That was a good question.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Every test that I've ever taken and every sort of like, juncture": null, "in my life at which I've had to make an important decision tells me": null, "Hercinil.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Erika:\u00a0In everything, you know, that's who I am.": null, "Lou:\u00a0You can't fight it, can't fight your destiny. Yeah, I think I will": null, "either in Hercinil or Chimeron.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Is this Lou Wilson, or is this the character?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, I like that we're talking about ourselves.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Which one are we, I thought we were talking about ourselves?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It wasn't specific.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think that I would be in Hercinil or Chimeron, I think the same": null, "of Whitney. I think Whitney is like in the same way that I feel like a": null, "lot of like athletes in high school either become hyper successful or": null, "are like, what's up, man. Yeah, I work at the plant.": null, "Yeah, I still got my jersey up on the wall, but yeah, I like make, you": null, "know, hubcaps now and I love it.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Only because of, like the ambition aspect of it. I think Sam": null, "might've been, Aqrabus just because of the ambition and you know, a": null, "little selfies, there's a reason selfie and selfish are pretty close.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yo.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0There's a reason that that happened. So I think that that": null, "would be a little bit of that. For me, I think it would be just like, I": null, "want to be Chimeron so bad. I just want to be cute and happy and just": null, "love when everybody else is happy and like loyal, but I would have": null, "gotten sorted into Hercinil just because of like the choices that I made": null, "and the things I've done, but I would be really, like, oh, we got to go": null, "save the school again? Can't we, don't we have like a backup team? Why": null, "we always got to put our bodies on the line?": null, "Danielle:\u00a0I feel like I would be very much in that energy.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0High risk, high reward house.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Chimeron.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Really?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Well, it depends 'cause for Gowpenny, is it like the trait that": null, "the school sees as exploitable in you or is it the thing you, the person": null, "value most?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I think it's closer to like clear like hero streak goes to": null, "Hercinil, clear like, you've just got antagonists written all over you.": null, "Like you're not quite the mold. Like it's like the acting thing of like,": null, "you're a great actor, but you don't have that like hero like face or": null, "you're probably like a villain, so we'll just give you the other one. So": null, "you're a big deal, but you just don't like fit that mold and then like": null, "Messanteu cause I also say Monsanto in my head every time and I'm like,": null, "this is the mistake I gave to myself. Panicking trying to say the word.": null, "I just liked that because I like the idea that you can fail out of that,": null, "but that's actually like the most like high strung house. And then like": null, "Chimeron is just everyone else. Like there's no trait associated, it's": null, "just, if you're not one of those other three, if you're not valuable to": null, "heroes or villains or heroic or villainy, like motivated, then you just.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yeah, I think that like in real life, you know, like at that age": null, "I probably would have been like, oh yeah, I want to be in the hero": null, "house, you know, this is where I belong, but now I'd probably": null, "deliberately go up there and choose to be in Chimeron just because, you": null, "know, it's like, it's a messed up system, you know?": null, "Erika:\u00a0It's tracking and it's not right.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Fuck, I hated that line 'cause that made me almost scream": null, "loudly, it is but I can't know.": null, "(Brennan laughs)": null, "I built like the weirdest game that you guys all play really, really": null, "well is the like immediately call out the problem, and I was like, okay,": null, "they're going to do it. I didn't track like how I would respond to it": null, "every time, which is I want to laugh and agree and I'm like, no, I have": null, "to be like the unreasonable voice in the room but yeah, it's real bad.": null, "(Erika laughs)": null, "Lou:\u00a0That's the burden you bear for us.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0This is about me now.": null, "Erika:\u00a0You have to be the adult in the dome, no.": null, "Lou:\u00a0That's why you get to sit behind the big wall.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0There you go.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, okay, I have a question about like the sort of budding": null, "romances that are happening here. How do we feel about that? How we feel": null, "about our crushes, what's going on there? Like everyone's doing stuff": null, "and it's real cute and good.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Yeah so there's one of the trio Fergus, which is just a hell": null, "of a name.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I'm so sorry.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0It's so good but there is a little bit of like a, we don't": null, "know what's going to happen yet 'cause right now it's just like lusty": null, "across from the room looks.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Glance.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Yeah, just like a little bit of like, hey, like I have a": null, "little bit of shyness, but you know, I think that Sam is so used to": null, "people paying attention to her through her screen that like, it's going": null, "to be interesting having someone pay attention to her in like life.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I did not consider that.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Ah. Screams forever.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's amazing.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Big old mood.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Hit hard, gut punch to Erika.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Well Sam has like had the most, I feel like Sam is immediately": null, "that person who's like more comfortable talking to a crowd and then": null, "talking to an individual, like so comfortable with the whole, when we": null, "were in the Chimeron common room being like, all right everybody,": null, "Lou:\u00a0Instructing everybody": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Like get your cucumbers, get your sausages": null, "And like completely sowing the seeds of chaos into the fabric of this": null, "school, but yeah, like having that one-on-one interaction is very, very": null, "weird, it's like, it's a very different thing.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Like Sam still has like the most raw charisma and like can talk": null, "down like a blood snake or Chimera.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yo that was fucking wild.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Right, I feel like this is so new because you know, she's young,": null, "but still, and just had the talk for the first time before she left for": null, "school.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Yep, just had the talk.": null, "Erika:\u00a0So like that's interesting, that's a whole other layer. I totally": null, "did not remember until just this moment.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I did forget that you talked blood back into Evan's body.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0That was so cool.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0I did, I talked blood back into his body": null, "Lou:\u00a0That whole scene of just somebody just raw ire.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It's so good.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Like it was funny you were like, it's a 16 roll and I think my": null, "brain went, I think like I clicked into D&D for a second. It was like,": null, "oh, well, if you fail, you fail and then I failed miserably and it's": null, "like, wait, if you fail by more than five, awful things happen and then": null, "awful things happened.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Lou:\u00a0But that whole scene was really sick. Just the image of raw iron": null, "jutting into a common room was like, oh, okay, yeah, we're magical. This": null, "is what happens when you give people who've lived 17 years without magic": null, "and then you're like, hey, you can go ahead.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yeah and there's certain things about that that needed to": null, "happen that way because if you just went like bippity boppity and": null, "there's a perfect P90X power block set in front of you, then we're like,": null, "what the fuck is this school for? What are we teaching me that I don't": null, "already kind of get? That was so, so fun. Yeah, that whole scene was": null, "great.": null, "Erika:\u00a0And like you got to imagine too, it's always difficult to": null, "remember that combat happens like not in real time. So that like": null, "immediately he summons up his giant iron spike, it like skewers Evan,": null, "who like has dove in front of the girls and like immediately like a": null, "blood snake comes out, Sam talks it down and then Dream like sears up,": null, "cauterizes his leg.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0So cool, that was so cool.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Like within the space of two minutes.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Well, I think like this is, you know, I'm gonna be a dork for a": null, "second, everyone's magic is telling a story here. Like I feel like Sam": null, "is someone who's like, almost like a perfectly realized witch of like my": null, "familiar is a teacup pig, perfectly damnable. Oh, you have like an evil": null, "blood cobra? Well, this is just a conversation. This is just like, fully": null, "actualized and I feel like it's also for Dream who wants to be dark and": null, "edgy, what's the first piece of magic you did? Healing somebody.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Ah.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It's like very cool and it goes counter to what she wants her": null, "deal to be.": null, "Erika:\u00a0And for Whitney, it's just like anything involving just like body": null, "or, you know, and just like all of his skills.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Potions, so fun.": null, "Lou:\u00a0If we're going to explode twice like that. We're going to be doing": null, "great things. You know, the exploding mechanic is fun in that it really": null, "does feel like there's such a satisfying thing to exploding and like,": null, "feeling like your character is doing something truly exceptional with": null, "every time that you hit that four.

In real life, if you had to take an ability from": null, "D&D, almost nothing would be better than just skill expertise or what is": null, "it like the rogue ability, like reliable talent where you can't roll": null, "below an eight.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Like, if I knew that I could never roll below an eight in": null, "persuasion check, fuck a magic missile.
