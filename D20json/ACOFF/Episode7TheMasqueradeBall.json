I owe you an": null, "apology, for I know that these are not the only rumors circulating about": null, "the Court of Wonder, nor indeed yourself.

In the absence of an explanation, I offered": null, "something that I thought would elevate the station of my court in my": null, "moment of humiliation.": null, "Rue: I need to tell you this.": null, "Surena: I climb off of you.": null, "[Aabria laughing]": null, "Surena: Climb on to\u2014": null, "Andhera: Do you want to go see the outside?": null, "BINX: [frog voice] I would love to see the outside.": null, "Andhera: Great, we'll be right back.": null, "BINX: I'll give you privacy.": null, "Surena: Yeah.": null, "Rue: Ah. Good, Captain Knickolas P. Hob.": null, "Brennan: Hearing my first name, my ears sort of flip back onto my head.": null, "[suspenseful music]": null, "Rue: I warn you the dangerous nature of rumors. This is why rumors are": null, "toxic. They form out of suspicion. And that's why this attack to Apollo": null, "is\u2014it worries me. It frightens me, because it's not really based on": null, "anything, is it?": null, "Captain Hob: We must learn. I understand that there is precious little": null, "information. I am waiting for the Prince Andhera and Ms. Choppley to": null, "find out what they can. But in a fog of mystery, the question of Goblin": null, "honor is at stake, and we cannot suffer this insult. Some would\u2014": null, "Rue: But what about you? What about your honor? You were used, Hob. Know": null, "that. Your personal victory in a big battle is the impetus of this": null, "marriage formed out of what, love? [laughs] Please. You were the": null, "instrument in which all of this chaos started. What did you get out of": null, "it? And now you carry out other people's failures. For what? Why? I": null, "implore you to start taking care of yourself and your feelings because": null, "no one in that court seems like they're doing that. You are so attentive": null, "to other people's feelings. What about your own?": null, "Captain Hob: I\u2026 [sniffling] I can raise neither objection nor reproach": null, "to the words you have spoken here. I had planned more to say, to speak": null, "to the nature of your character and of your bravery that you have": null, "exhibited in this Bloom, but I now know that my stature is of a nature": null, "that those compliments would be unworthy. You deserve this more than I.": null, "Brennan: And the medal I took off my sash, I place into your hand. And": null, "it is a medal of courage. And I think, holding back tears, I turn and": null, "walk out the door.": null, "Oscar: I'm not going to stop him, but I will say, as he's walking out": null, "the door,": null, "Rue: Captain, take care of yourself. Don't act impulsively and think": null, "about why you are doing the things that you're doing. Why bring out": null, "things that have been left dead and buried for so long? You might": null, "uncover things you don't want. What is this actually for? Pray, protect": null, "yourself.": null, "Brennan: I rush into the storm.": null, "Oscar: I take a moment, collect myself. I look out.": null, "BINX: Oh yeah, so when I was in the Mortal Realm, we would just hide a": null, "lot of socks.": null, "Andhera: Oh, so that's where they go.": null, "BINX: That's where they go. Have you been to the Mortal Realm? It's": null, "great.": null, "Andhera: I have read about it in books.": null, "BINX: Do you read a lot of books?": null, "Andhera: I hate to brag.": null, "BINX: But you're gonna, because that's what the next sentence is, right?": null, "Andhera: [laughing] I've read like so many fucking books. It's like my": null, "trademark.": null, "BINX:\u00a0That\u2019s amazing.": null, "Oscar: Can I make an Insight check on these two?": null, "Aabria: Please do.": null, "Oscar: There's a connection. Oh fuck.": null, "Surena: Unclear.": null, "Oscar: 12.": null, "Aabria: I'm not gonna make you guys roll against it. This is a like,": null, "nice moment, but I do think it's worth saying you just had a whole big": null, "thing and suddenly turning your focus outward is not as effective. Also,": null, "Polymorph only lasts an hour.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Oh, shoot.": null, "Aabria: And you've got to hustle.": null, "Rue: I'm afraid to interrupt this, but we have to go.": null, "BINX: Well, we'll continue this later. I have so much to tell you.": null, "Probably better that I'm different.": null, "Andhera: [stuttering] As you were. Um, I\u2014yeah. Obviously\u2014": null, "Rue: Bye!": null, "Oscar: And then I hurry my way to the Sea Foam.": null, "[dramatic string music]": null, "Aabria: You exit out into the night, tiny frog friend on your chest, and": null, "make your way down through the city and out across like, the tidal lane": null, "to get to the beach on the other side. I do need you to make a Stealth": null, "check, though, as you go.": null, "Oscar: Ooh, that's a 2. [laughing]": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Your head is down and you're moving quickly. And there": null, "are people, lesser Fey mostly, in this part of the city that are sort of": null, "moving by. And as you make your way and try to be as discreet as you can": null, "in this moment, you don't notice the like, curly, white hair that": null, "flashes by you as you move. But she noticed.": null, "And you make your way to the Sea Foam Court's little jasmine garden, and": null, "you see sort of standing and waiting for you, the Wave Master, Lady": null, "Ephendra, Baroness Alven, and Sorwen, who is sort of known as the Sea": null, "Wall, the Champion of the Sea Foam Court, and Wannessa, the human,": null, "looking a little sleepy and out of sorts, and is kind of just lazing in": null, "the grass, and gives you a little wave hello as you come to meet them.": null, "Oscar: I do a deep bow to\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It is returned.": null, "Oscar: All members of the Sea Foam Court. And I say,": null, "Rue: Thank you, Wave Master, and the rest of the Sea Foam Court,": null, "including our dear Wannessa, for having me and listening to what I have": null, "to say.": null, "Aabria: The Wave Master obviously sort of takes point on this, and you": null, "see that Baroness Alven is actually, like, taking notes.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Hmm.": null, "Aabria: For whatever that's worth and whatever you wanna do with that.": null, "Wave Master: Of course, we are grateful for your work thus far, and": null, "would love to discuss whatever it is you would like to discuss.": null, "Rue: I'd like to know how you are enjoying the Bloom as of now. And if": null, "you have any notes on what I can do to improve the standing of the Bloom": null, "to your liking, I would greatly appreciate it.": null, "Aabria: Hmm. Give me an Insight check.": null, "Oscar: Ooh. [humming] That's a 12.": null, "Aabria: The Wave Master's face is fairly inscrutable because it is only": null, "vaguely humanoid. This is wave made flesh and form, and you can tell": null, "more from body language than from, like, any inscrutability around where": null, "their eyes or a puckering of a mouth would be, but there is a coldness": null, "and stillness before they speak again.": null, "Wave Master: Everything has been exemplary. You are a credit to your": null, "court.": null, "Rue: [clears throat] Thank you for the kind words. I do want to bring": null, "something up in terms of the Court of Craft. As you know, they've made": null, "their debut in a magnificent, I would say, display of performanceship.": null, "And I would like to know how you feel about the Court of Craft attending": null, "the Bloom.": null, "Wave Master: Hmm. If I'm being incredibly honest, it is a surprise that": null, "she is here, but we would never be so rude as to deny hospitality to the": null, "leader of a court, diminished though it may be.": null, "Rue: Is the court fully diminished if there's one person present or is": null, "it waning? I have heard stories that the Court of Craft is in need of": null, "magic.": null, "Aabria: And at this, you hear Alven kind of [coughing].": null, "Rue: What's that?": null, "Baroness Alven: Hmm? Oh, well, I mean, are we just gonna not talk about": null, "the fact that yours is the foil to the Court of Craft? If their magic is": null, "gone, we all have our guesses about who's responsible.": null, "Rue: And who is that?": null, "[tense instrumental music]": null, "Baroness Alven: The Court of Wonder. Oh, I'm sorry, are we not\u2014 we could": null, "just have this conversation.": null, "Rue: No, I just wanted you to say Court of Wonder if\u2014": null, "Baroness Alven: Yes, your court. So shouldn't we be asking you how you": null, "feel about a loose end appearing?": null, "Rue: [sighs] I\u2026 I'm here as the Master of Ceremony, not as a member of": null, "the Court of Wonder. I will not speak for the court.": null, "Baroness Alven: You are a member. If not you, then who?": null, "Rue: Literally anyone else.": null, "Baroness Alven: Okay.": null, "Rue: You know that I'm barely at the Court of Wonder. I have been busy": null, "preparing this entire Bloom.": null, "Baroness Alven: We understand that. And we like you. That's why we are": null, "happy, willing to have this conversation with you. But when it comes": null, "down to it, isn't that the whole thing we're doing here? We, 100": null, "generations ago, decided to form courts and alliances to bolster": null, "ourselves and make ourselves stronger and more secure, and we have held": null, "to those lines for millennia. So you can say with your full chest and": null, "your glorious, true self, who you are, but you are still the premier": null, "member of the Court of Wonder, and every word you say rings with their": null, "authority. And you are a fool to think that anyone doesn't understand": null, "that when interacting with you. So if we are being gracious, if a little": null, "curt, know that it is because the Sea Foam Court does not want to incur": null, "the wrath of the Court of Wonder.": null, "Rue: Understood. I appreciate the honesty intended in which you've told": null, "me this.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna need a Performance check from this little frog.": null, "[laughs]": null, "Surena: [chuckles]\u00a0Oh my God, oh my God.": null, "Omar: You have Bardic Inspiration.": null, "Surena: Oh, oh, oh God.": null, "Aabria: Stop reminding her.": null, "[Omar laughs]": null, "Surena: Okay, that was cocked.": null, "Aabria: I want this frog.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0You also have the Lucky feat!": null, "Surena: 20, 20! [hands clapping]": null, "Oscar: Nat 20.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Natural 20?": null, "Surena: Natural 20.": null, "Aabria: Amazing.": null, "Surena: Thank you, Bardic Inspiration.": null, "Aabria: You tremble a little bit as your court is being discussed, but": null, "you hold it together. And, clearly, the eyes of everyone here are locked": null, "in this strange moment with you specifically as they state quite boldly": null, "and quite baldly that it is the fear of your court that keeps their": null, "tongues from being even sharper.": null, "Rue: Hmm. Like I said, I cannot speak for the Court of Wonder, but since": null, "you've been such gracious hosts in the Bloom, I would love any input as": null, "to how the Court of Wonder can at least contribute to the quelling of": null, "this rumor that I am very well\u2014I know that you are very well\u2014know that": null, "you fucking know, okay?": null, "[whimsical instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: And you actually see as you drop a little F bomb, they actually": null, "all kind of relax a little bit. Like, \"Oh, we've said the thing.\" And": null, "you even see that the jasmine in and around the garden opens up a little": null, "bit more and releases its scent into the air as this like tension goes": null, "out of the meeting.": null, "Wave Master: [sighs] Look, we are deeply grateful to the magic lent to": null, "us through your efforts and from your court. We understand that this": null, "would not be as glorious as it is without you. My fear, and my fear for": null, "my court, is where your ambitions lie next.": null, "Rue: My personal ones or the one of the Court?": null, "Wave Master: The one of the Court of Wonder. Do you plan on\u2014maybe it's": null, "better if it's not said.": null, "Rue: No, please.": null, "Wave Master: When things are spoken, it brings them closer to being. We": null, "have bolstered our alliances with the Court of Stone. We believe that if": null, "advances are made by the Court of Wonder, we will be able to hold out": null, "long enough for reinforcements to arrive.": null, "Rue: I understand what you mean by that. [sighs]": null, "Wave Master: I don't know if there's any assurances you could make, but": null, "that is our fear, not about the execution of a series of parties. Lovely": null, "though they are, sorry. Not to denigrate your work.": null, "Rue: No, no, no. No offense taken. Having this meeting with all of you": null, "has made me very well aware that I must have my own meeting with the": null, "Court of Wonder.": null, "[BINX groans]": null, "[Rue coughs theatrically]": null, "Rue: I'm sorry. Had a very full dinner and [coughs]. Ahem.": null, "Aabria: Deception check.": null, "[Oscar laughing]": null, "Omar: Oh, oh, oh.": null, "Oscar: That is a 16.": null, "Surena: 17.": null, "Lou: A 2, and you got a 16?": null, "Surena: No, this is a 7 and I have a +10 in Deception.": null, "Lou: Oh no, him.": null, "Oscar: Oh, wait, Deception, sorry. 2, 8.": null, "Surena: You have a 6.": null, "Brennan: Ooh!": null, "Surena: Ah, yikes!": null, "Lou: I was about to be like,\"A 2 to a 16, goddamn!\"": null, "Emily: Is this 3.5?": null, "Aabria: Just\u2014Inspiration, something? I treasure you.": null, "Lou: Yes. Hey, I got you. We ain't gonna let this bullshit fly.": null, "[group laughing] [Aabria claps]": null, "Oscar: I was looking at my Performance. It was an honest mistake.": null, "Lou: Yeah, I bet you were. I bet you were.": null, "Aabria: What you see, then, as you're kind of laughing and taking this": null, "off, is that the Court of Sea Foam's main members are more like, they're": null, "busy exchanging glances between one another, but it's Wannessa\u2014": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh no.": null, "Aabria: Whose eyes flare with like, right at the center of her pupils, a": null, "little purple glow, like a red eye effect, as her Detect Magic is": null, "focused on you.": null, "Oscar: Oh, she has Detect Magic. That's cool.": null, "Lou: Wannessa, yes.": null, "Aabria: And is doing a much worse job than both of you at being like,": null, "\"Yeah, fly casual.\"": null, "Surena: So casual right now. [laughing]": null, "Aabria: Yeah. A matched energy, for sure. [group laughing] But she's not": null, "gonna say anything, but she absolutely notices.": null, "Rue: [clears throat] So, with that, and if there's nothing else to be": null, "discussed, I would take my leave if it pleases the court.": null, "Wave Master: It was planned as maybe a bit of a slight, but given this": null, "conversation, we think it is in everyone's best interest to mention that": null, "a small change has been made to the ball.": null, "Rue: Oh?": null, "[ominous music]": null, "Wave Master: The invitations that were sent out outlined that it is, in": null, "fact, a masquerade, with maybe some intonations that glamors and the": null, "revelation of true selves was a important theme across this Bloom. Beg": null, "your pardon for taking a jab at your moment.": null, "Rue: I take no offense to that. Thank you for being honest.": null, "Wave Master: And for whatever it's worth, The Sea Foam Court has many": null, "types of beings in a myriad of shapes and sizes, and we have never cared": null, "about the outward look. It has always been your sharp mind and keen eye": null, "that has garnered our still-continuing respect, but we were feeling kind": null, "of cunty with the Court of Wonder stuff, and that's just what that was.": null, "And I'm so sorry.": null, "Rue: No, I mean, no offense. I mean, I get it, but like\u2014": null, "Rue: Honestly, like I feel\u2014real talk?": null, "Wave Master: Yeah.": null, "Rue: Like I feel\u2014": null, "Rue: And thank you, honestly. You do me great honor for having me here": null, "and speaking so plainly. Thank you to everyone in the Sea Foam Court,": null, "and thank you, Wannessa.": null, "Aabria: She's just,": null, "Wannessa:\u00a0[strained] Yeah. Yeah. You're so welcome. [exhales] Tell": null, "Gwyndolin I said hi.": null, "Rue: Yes, I will. [coughing] I will, yes. Well, there is much to do and,": null, "well, we have a ball\u2014": null, "Wave Master: We have a ball.": null, "Rue: To do, so I must away.": null, "Aabria: You are escorted out, not by the Wave Master, who has gone into": null, "conference with the Lady and Baroness, but it's actually Sorwen, the Sea": null, "Wall, the sort of champion of the Sea Foam Court, who walks you out and": null, "will escort you back through the lane up to like the main island. And as": null, "he's walking, will just say,": null, "Sorwen: People move courts all the time. That's all.": null, "Rue: [sighs] It's frustrating. You understand? The things that I do is": null, "based on my merits, and to be associated with a court that you have very": null, "little to do with is very frustrating. You must understand this. I mean": null, "no disrespect, but I do understand that just by my presence, I speak for": null, "a court that has very little to do with me.": null, "Sorwen: I understand.": null, "Aabria: Make a Performance check as he kind of just sizes you up. Damn,": null, "that was a natural 1.": null, "Omar: And you have a +16.": null, "Oscar: It's a 7, uh, 18.": null, "Aabria: He studies you intently.": null, "Sorwen: Okay.

That's the part that we haven't been able to suss out.": null, "Chirp: We don't know. No one ever told us.": null, "Apollo: Oh?": null, "Squak:\u00a0I am truly\u2014": null, "Apollo: That's fucked.": null, "Squak: I'm not gonna lie, I'm terrified, Apollo, that it's just some": null, "sort of moralistic revelation.

There's more cigars.

I still have four cigars in my finger.": null, "Aabria: And you know what? Yeah, with that, Suntar is gonna walk": null, "forward, and she conjures like, a little, purple flame at the edge of": null, "her fingertips and lights all four?": null, "Suntar: In case your birds smoke. I don't know.": null, "Chirp: Oh, you're right. Hi, babies.": null, "Chirp: Did you want some? Say yes because you have a vocabulary of 800": null, "to 1,000 words.": null, "Suntar: Well, let's be frank.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Oh, hello.": null, "Suntar: We've heard what's been said about you, that you're secretly in": null, "a relationship?": null, "[Squak laughs dismissively]": null, "Suntar: That you are looking for a love match after having your heart": null, "broken?": null, "Chirp: Is that being said about me?": null, "Suntar: Rumors before the Bloom ever began.": null, "Chirp: I like rumors, though.

Don't swallow it.": null, "Chirp: It's coming out of your cloaca.": null, "Squak: It's about the mouth feel. It's about the mouth feel.": null, "Chirp: It's about the mouth feel.": null, "Lou: Uh, 16.": null, "[string music]": null, "Aabria: Yeah. So while you're kind of lost in that thought, the thing": null, "you see as your cousin speaks is that Suntar looks utterly unfazed about": null, "the idea of something on the side. This does not matter to her. There's": null, "something hungry for what this is.": null, "Aabria: And it's not to like, be able to guess at any sort of her intent": null, "or sexuality.": null, "Lou: Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It's just that it is not even a thought.": null, "Aabria: The look you get from Apollo is that little bit of a smirk that": null, "you recognize on yourself when you're sending letters back and forth": null, "with Theodore.": null, "Aabria: Of that little, like, \"Yeah, I've got mine, and we don't worry": null, "about it.\"": null, "Squak: Oh.

And he seems intent on doing so.": null, "Squak: Yeah, but I mean, this is even\u2014the match I already had arranged": null, "was, you know, but this, I mean\u2014": null, "Chirp: Yes. And Suntar, my entire fucking thing is make a match and then": null, "head back to the Material Plane to enjoy the short lives of my beautiful": null, "family.": null, "Squak: And the vibes I'm catching off of her is that's okay.": null, "Chirp: That's okay.": null, "Squak: Honestly, Apollo gave me a look that I don't mind.": null, "Chirp: I think the two of you could get down. Let me just see what": null, "they're saying.": null, "Emily: And I wanna listen in on my African Grays and see what's being": null, "said.": null, "[Omar and Brennan gasping]": null, "Aabria: Amazing!": null, "All:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Aabria: Aw, fuck, that's good.

Just having a very animated\u2014": null, "Chirp: Yes, let\u2019s have like, a really\u2014okay, yeah, if I could just be": null, "quiet, and you just maybe pretend like you're telling me a really": null, "animated story.": null, "Lou comedically mimes animated storytelling.": null, "Aabria: Alright, so what you pick up is Suntar moving very close and": null, "sort of like whispering in Prince Apollo's ear and saying,": null, "Suntar: We should just tell them. We should let them know. If we bring": null, "them in, they'll be more likely to say yes.": null, "Aabria: And you hear Apollo respond,": null, "Apollo: Okay, calm down. Hold on. Let me get rid of Wuvvy and then we": null, "can speak freely.": null, "Emily: I Message this to my cousin.": null, "Squak: Oh, yes?": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Like, in my head.": null, "Squak: Yes?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh my God, there's so\u2014": null, "Chirp: It's me in your head.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna need a Performance check.": null, "Lou: Okay, happily.": null, "Aabria: From both of you to like, maintain the listen, send the spell,": null, "and maintain like a kayfabe of conversation.": null, "Emily: Oh my God. You know what? I got so many trinkets I'm gonna burn.": null, "Can I burn one to just succeed?": null, "Emily: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019ll just burn one to succeed.": null, "Lou: I'll take a 14.": null, "Aabria: 14'll do it.": null, "Emily hands Aabria the grey feather.": null, "Emily: Yeah? Oh, this was from Grandfather. Take it.": null, "Aabria: And in that moment, you feel your bandwidth split in too many": null, "directions and even high, though you are, your flow through the Arcane": null, "Veil isn't enough to maintain all of this, and your hand sort of": null, "instinctively reaches into your pocket where you feel that little": null, "feather. You don't remember putting it in your pocket. You don't really": null, "remember receiving it.": null, "Chirp: Grandfather.": null, "Aabria: And it burns away and you feel a surge of magic as you sort of": null, "step back from yourself, and you're able to maintain equal focus on all": null, "of these things, and all of these pieces in front of you. And it looks": null, "like you're looking down at a chess board.": null, "Chirp: They say women are good at multitasking.": null, "Aabria: And in the moment, yeah, just as this is wrapping up, Prince": null, "Apollo is sort of like giving a polite, like,": null, "Apollo: Wuvvy, you have things to attend to.": null, "Aabria: She kind of pops up,": null, "Wuvvy: Okay, yeah. Thank you for the drinks. Okay, I've got to\u2026 a ball.": null, "Aabria: And then takes off and leaves.": null, "Chirp: Is there a complication to the fact that we talked about betting": null, "against ourself in front of Wuvvy?": null, "Squak: I mean, if there is, I don't mind.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, right? She goes and says, \"Oh, they bet against": null, "themselves.\" There's nothing in the wager that says we can't bet against": null, "ourselves.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Bet against ourselves. Of course.": null, "Chirp: Okay, okay.": null, "Lou: And I'm gonna grab the catfish and throw it out the window.": null, "Aabria: \u201cOw!\u201d As it hits, it immediately turns back into Ruyin.

Did I kill this man?": null, "Aabria: No.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh, okay.": null, "Aabria: He only dropped a couple stories, but definitely turned back and": null, "took a shit ton of damage.": null, "Chirp: Sorry, I overheard you saying, \"Should we tell them something?\"": null, "Oscar: Oh, damn.": null, "Apollo: What?": null, "Chirp: What were you talking about?": null, "Apollo: How did you\u2026?": null, "Emily: Gift of Gab. Gift of Gab; I did not say that.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Emily: Reaction.": null, "Aabria: And he's like,": null, "Apollo: Why am I close to the bird now?": null, "Apollo: Sorry, what was that? I missed something.": null, "Chirp: It's okay, we're all smoking a lot of cigars.": null, "Chirp: Speaking of which, babies?": null, "Apollo: Yes.": null, "Chirp: Come back. Come back, take your medicine.": null, "Squak: It's an essential item for the Lords of the Wing.": null, "Apollo: Smoking?": null, "Apollo: Okay. I'm sorry. Well, I hope your conversation was to my": null, "satisfaction. How are you feeling? I would happily continue to court": null, "Chirp: I think we are feeling fantastic about it. The only loose end": null, "would, as you all know, you have presumably overbearing parents, and we": null, "will need to confer with our grandfather. But I think we're going to": null, "confer with him and he's going to be so delighted.": null, "Apollo: He scares me.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Oh. He scares me.": null, "Chirp: He's fucking terrifying.": null, "Squak: He threatened to eat us.": null, "\u00a0[group laughing]": null, "Chirp: Yeah. Birds often eat their young\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What?": null, "Chirp: And it comes from Grandfather.": null, "Squak: That's the thing he just did normally, and he gave that to birds.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yeah, yeah. And he gave that to birds.": null, "Apollo: Oh no. He's like all of the bad parts of birds.": null, "Squak: He is all of the bad parts of birds, but God do I love him. God,": null, "do I love him up there.": null, "Chirp: I see you up there.": null, "Aabria: In this moment, sort of Prince Apollo and Princess Suntar, like": null, "looking back and forth and looking at you and kind of eyeing you.": null, "Emily: Subtle Spell Message to my cousin,": null, "Chirp: Run interference.": null, "Squak: Apollo.": null, "Lou: I'm gonna slide my hand\u2014": null, "Chirp: On both.

It's the Piegeron.": null, "Apollo: Is it always that size?": null, "Squak: Always.": null, "Chirp: Always. Always.": null, "Apollo:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Chirp: They are an apex predator.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Truly.": null, "Apollo: The eyes would suggest\u2014": null, "Squak: Oh, you're talking about the eyes?": null, "Apollo:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Squak: Well, and in that is their greatest strength, in that they are": null, "always underestimating the Piegeron.": null, "Chirp: The Piegeron.": null, "Squak: Hurry, I can't keep this Piegeron.": null, "Aabria: Give me a Sleight of Hand check, 'cause there are other people": null, "in this room.": null, "Lou: And you still have the Bardic.": null, "Emily: I will\u2014how much is Bardic?": null, "Lou: 8, d8.": null, "Emily: I gotta make this work, baby, so we're going for it.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna let you know\u2014": null, "Emily: 21 plus 8\u2014": null, "Emily: 29.": null, "Aabria: I was gonna say some shit, and it truly doesn't matter.

In the shadow of the great Piegeron!": null, "Apollo: Well, sure, okay. Where's my glass?": null, "Aabria: And Prince Apollo will pick up his glass, and pick up the one": null, "beside it that was for Suntar, and they'll like, take 'em.": null, "Apollo: Oh, let's get you drinks!": null, "Aabria: And a servant appears, like a gold automaton offers you a glass\u2014": null, "Emily: Can I sniff it to see if they've drugged ours?": null, "Aabria: Ooh, yeah, gimme an Arcana check.": null, "Emily: 14.": null, "Aabria: You don't smell the presence of any magical effect on this.": null, "Squak: To possibly being\u2014": null, "Chirp: To possibly finding a strategic marriage.": null, "Apollo: Amazing.

That's good.": null, "Lou: Aw, but a cool 3.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Wait, what is Cutting Word?": null, "Lou: I can knock down an attack roll, an ability check, or damage roll.": null, "So I guess if this is a saving throw, I cannot. So I apologize.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna allow it.": null, "[group cheering]": null, "Emily:\u00a0Yeah!": null, "Omar: Yes!": null, "Omar: Love this game.": null, "Aabria: Now you two, still on your respective drugs that give you a": null, "little bit of arcane lean, the way Zone of Truth normally works is that": null, "the caster would have information about who passed or failed them, but": null, "because this is a spell effect from a potion, technically no one would": null, "know if it worked or not.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: But you guys can both make Arcana checks.

Truth be told, we heard you over there talking about": null, "whether or not to tell us something. And we feel as though we've been": null, "very transparent and we would, you know\u2014we said our needs going into": null, "this, and if there's something that you're not telling us, of course, we": null, "want to know.": null, "Apollo: I mean, we're all friends and potentially lovers here.": null, "Squak: We'll see.": null, "Apollo:\u00a0We'll see.": null, "Chirp: Maybe in 40 years.": null, "Apollo: Weirdly specific.": null, "[intense string music]": null, "Aabria: And Suntar kind of just folds her hands and sort of cedes the": null, "ground to Prince Apollo, just,": null, "Apollo: Honestly, well, if we're going to be getting into bed together,": null, "the truth of the matter is it's been a matter of rumor, but also a": null, "matter of fact that the Unseelie Court has been looking to curtail": null, "access to the Mortal Planes. And when I originally reached out to": null, "Suntar, more so to ask why than anything else, it occurred to me that": null, "the Court of Wonder and the Unseelie Court had something interesting in": null, "common.": null, "Squak: Hmm.": null, "Apollo:\u00a0The stockpiling of magic, 'cause it flows into the Mortal Realm": null, "via those portals.

Or shall we just bring up the potential matches?": null, "Apollo: Oh, you\u2014I leave that to you.": null, "Apollo: That's on you. And we obviously don't expect a response now. We": null, "will say that those of us sort of in the know, our colors will be royal": null, "blue at the masquerade.

Can we do strawberries? Can we do": null, "strawberries?

So whatever the Fey equivalent is of that.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Hey!": null, "Andhera: Hello? Is this okay?": null, "Omar: And I glance out to the hallway.": null, "Andhera: Uh, good day, BINX. Do you mind if I step in very quickly?": null, "BINX: Oh, of course. Yeah, come in.": null, "Andhera: Great, not a vampire.": null, "Omar: And I close the door.": null, "Andhera: I had an interesting request, if that's all right.": null, "Andhera: I wanted to put together an outfit for later today, for the": null, "BINX: Oh.": null, "Andhera: And I have some that are pre-selected, but I thought in order": null, "to make somewhat of an appearance, I was wondering if maybe I could": null, "bother your talents a little bit?": null, "BINX: I would be so happy to craft you a suit or anything you want. What": null, "are you thinking? What statement do you wanna make?": null, "Andhera: Prince of Darkness.": null, "BINX: Darkness?": null, "Andhera:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "BINX: Great, great, great.": null, "Surena: And BINX is pulling through her drawers and is taking out": null, "various fabrics.": null, "BINX: Continue, describe!": null, "Andhera: Oh, something\u2014if you stared at it for a long time, it would": null, "look like obsidian stalagmites, like, collected together. That's sort of": null, "the pattern of it. But you don't wanna look for too long.": null, "BINX: [muttering] Stalagmites\u2026 So I'm gonna do hypnotizing stalagmites.": null, "Great, great, great. Okay, uh huh, uh huh.": null, "Surena:\u00a0And I flip a mannequin that had been tipped over. I flip it and": null, "it goes upright and I start like I'm sewing.": null, "Andhera: Wow, that was absolutely fantastic.": null, "BINX:\u00a0No, no, no, continue.": null, "Andhera: Oh, yeah.": null, "Surena: So I'm throwing rocks on it and I'm like bead-working rocks.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Uh huh?": null, "Omar:\u00a0Oh, great. Form-fitting?": null, "BINX: Form-fitting, okay. Arms out.": null, "Andhera: Like as if I'm\u2014?": null, "BINX: Out right now.": null, "Andhera: Oh, oh, yes. Oh, yeah.": null, "Surena: I'm measuring you.": null, "Andhera: Mm-hmm, great, yes.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Okay?": null, "Andhera: Thank you, okay, yeah.": null, "BINX: Uh huh?": null, "Andhera: And, you know what, fuck it, maybe like a little, like,": null, "gemstone rock crown.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Gemstone rock crown.": null, "Andhera: Of sorts, like a cave crown, whatever that would be.": null, "BINX:\u00a0A cave crown?": null, "Andhera: Yeah. Or like a cave tiara. Maybe not a full crown, not the": null, "whole thing. Just like a head piece.": null, "BINX: No, no, no. Hey, you can get a full crown. You don't have to get a": null, "half crown or a tiara. You can get a full crown.": null, "Andhera: Great. In that case, a full crown please.": null, "Surena: Right. From like, the back, it's like my living quarters sort of": null, "expand as I'm moving through them. So if we're close, it seems really": null, "small, but I can like, move further out and it gets a little larger. I": null, "now have a welding mask and some flame, and I am welding you your crown": null, "currently.": null, "BINX: This might take a little bit. Thank you for trusting me with this.": null, "This is great. I actually haven't made anything for anyone else in a": null, "really long time. So this is like one of the best days I've had in": null, "probably a while.": null, "Andhera: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, and so glad I'm able to change": null, "that pattern, I suppose.": null, "BINX: Well, you know, it's fine. You get used to being alone. You know": null, "what I mean? Like, you make friends, like, and then, you know, they only": null, "have short lifespans, all of them. And so then you just get new friends": null, "for a little bit.": null, "Andhera: Most of my friends were rocks growing up. [chuckles]": null, "BINX: That's right, you did say that.": null, "Andhera: And my dog.": null, "BINX: So you're used to being kind of alone then?": null, "Andhera: Yes, actually. Yes, absolutely. So something we have in common,": null, "I suppose.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Andhera: Yeah.": null, "BINX: But you come from a court, though. I guess I don't really": null, "understand why you were alone when you had a court of people who would,": null, "you know, support you and be around you and would give you cocoa and\u2014": null, "Andhera: Oh, cocoa and support. [laughs]": null, "BINX:\u00a0And blankets and stuff, and like\u2014": null, "Andhera: That would be nice.": null, "BINX: Is that not\u2026?": null, "Andhera: No, no, the sort of general philosophy, I suppose, of the": null, "Unseelie Court is one of very intense and unhealthy stoicism, I would go": null, "so far as to say.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Andhera: Were I to have any notes, of which I have many [chuckles] of my": null, "family. My mother, the Queen of Air and Darkness.": null, "BINX: Yes, I've heard of\u2026 your mother.": null, "Andhera: [laughs] That's an accurate\u2014what have you heard? And you cannot": null, "offend me, if I'm being quite honest.": null, "BINX: Well, I've heard that she is the Queen of Air and Darkness, both": null, "in and out. She has and contains no heart or care for anything other": null, "than herself. That's what I've heard, but I'm not sure if that's true.": null, "And obviously, if she has children, she must care about those, you.": null, "Andhera: You would think. No, no, no, no. She definitely cares about the": null, "reputation of her offspring\u2014": null, "Andhera: And her creations. But, no, if I may share some personal": null, "information\u2014": null, "BINX: Oh, I would love nothing more. Please.": null, "Surena: Like, sparks everywhere.": null, "[solemn instrumental music]": null, "Andhera: She keeps everyone very separate because sentiment, where I": null, "grew up, is seen as a weakness, which I thought was funny because I": null, "thought, well, that's fear, then, you're scared of something, right?": null, "Andhera: And that wasn't taken too well. They called me a very emotional": null, "child. I was often described as hysterical, 'cause I would laugh.": null, "Sometimes my laughter would carry through the caverns and\u2026 They,": null, "actually, this thing I have in the back of my neck, this elemental": null, "shard, was put in such that anytime I am emotional, a cloud forms over": null, "my head.": null, "Surena: She kind of lowers her welding tools. She flips open her mask": null, "and says,": null, "BINX: Your mother put something inside of you so you wouldn't feel": null, "feelings?": null, "Andhera: Oh, well, it's not that I\u2014they realized pretty quickly I": null, "couldn't stop the feelings. So it was sort of like a humiliation tactic": null, "in a way to say, like, if you're gonna feel them, it's going to": null, "literally rain on you, and then you'll just be, you know, wet and": null, "miserable for a bit.": null, "BINX: Please pardon me if I am too forward in asking this question. Can": null, "I see it?": null, "Andhera: Yes, absolutely.": null, "Omar: And I turn and I move the collar of my robe.": null, "Surena: What does it look like? Like how\u2014can I tell how it was inserted": null, "in them?": null, "Omar: Yeah, I suppose it wouldn't take\u2014oh, it wasn't done with any high": null, "intense crafting magic. It was kind of a punishment. So, I imagine you'd": null, "be able to.": null, "Aabria: So what you see is this like swirling, black\u2014it's obsidian, but": null, "instead of like, that snowflake defect inside it, you see somehow darker": null, "black that's deeper. Whereas the shininess of the obsidian reflects": null, "light, these dark spots catch it and you feel yourself like": null, "instinctively moving into it.": null, "It is driven in the back of his neck as a spike and his skin has grown": null, "around it. And the very edges of it, no matter how long you've had this,": null, "they're still raw. It's still unhealed, but it's there and it's solid.": null, "And you can see, even as he kind of adjusts himself, like the": null, "musculature of his neck and shoulders, everything has shifted to hold": null, "this piece, but it is not of him.": null, "BINX: Well, there was no care in its placement.": null, "Andhera: Hmm.": null, "BINX: We're new friends, and I don't want to do anything that would make": null, "you uncomfortable or fearful. But if ever you feel like you want this": null, "removed, please know that I can do it.": null, "Omar: And they search for words. And while they might have like, read": null, "them, I think the emotional vocabulary isn't quite there yet to fully": null, "respond. And like, all those attempts at grasping and holding onto that": null, "feeling is almost like grabbing at smoke a little bit.": null, "Omar: And so instead, the prince finds one way through which to": null, "communicate everything, and just turns to you and looks directly at you,": null, "as I think a little bit of like a cloud forms over, but it's like a very": null, "stable, like, coastal storm that just sits on a cliff side for like a": null, "couple days.": null, "Andhera: It has been the nature of my family to pit siblings against one": null, "another for quite a time, because there was this idea of scarcity of": null, "love in my family. And nothing quite clicked until hearing you talk": null, "about magic. The way you see magic is that magic is love, a plant": null, "reaching up for the sun, the affinity between people and things.": null, "Andhera: And it occurred to me that, the Fey, we treat magic as if there": null, "is scarcity to it, in the same way that we feel that there's a scarcity": null, "to love. And it's something to manipulate, move around like pieces on a": null, "game board. That can't be correct.": null, "[soft piano music]": null, "BINX: For me, in my Court, magic is love. Magic is feelings. Magic is": null, "anger. Magic is, you know, is everything, but\u2026 there are Fey out there": null, "who do wish to withhold or keep, capture, siphon magic. And, as such,": null, "is, you know, why I\u2014that's what happened to everyone. Except for I found": null, "a loophole, you see. I found a way to create sort of like a\u2014I don't know": null, "another term for it other than a washing machine, like a spinning cycle": null, "of movement and magic that can happen between belief and the Mortal": null, "Plane. And I work with three others who believe in me, and together, we": null, "create magic. And that's how I am here. The last Weaver of Fate, the": null, "one, you know, the leader, they are a tree now. They are a tree, just a": null, "beautiful, static tree in the Mortal Plane. They couldn't get back. And": null, "that's what happens. We have to be able to come back, and then go there,": null, "because\u2026 we are of here, so.": null, "Surena: And at a loss for words, and realizing that they said so many": null, "things, she starts kind of frantically working back onto the\u2014": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna need a Performance check to create this outfit.": null, "Surena: Yes.": null, "Aabria: The DC is 20.": null, "Oscar: Oh.": null, "Emily: Ooh.": null, "Surena: Oh, okay I'm going to roll Lucky, roll Lucky. [groans] Okay,": null, "okay. DC is 20?": null, "Aabria: Mm-hmm.": null, "Surena: I rolled a 17. 17 plus 7.": null, "Aabria: 24.": null, "Brennan: Ooh, 24!": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So yeah, you're able to construct this crown, and this": null, "sort of dark stalagmite, stalactite outfit to match it.": null, "Aabria: And you continue talking and move on. Do you have one more": null, "thing? I'm gonna bounce away from you in a second.": null, "Omar: Yeah, is it okay?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, go ahead.": null, "Omar: Andhera collects all the information. And as you finish that,": null, "Andhera just, very gently, they put like, one hand on your shoulders to": null, "turn you.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Omar: And\u2014": null, "[Emily humming] [Aabria laughing] [Emily humming]": null, "Emily: Studio audience.": null, "[group laughing] [Emily humming]": null, "Lou: Sorry, your moment.": null, "Omar: Breaks their hand across [group laughing] the shoulder blades.": null, "Andhera: Before I was established as a prince to go out into the world,": null, "I was a squire of sorts, the way that my court works. And after being a": null, "squire, right before being a prince, I was a knight. Lady BINX, what is": null, "the royal term for your Courts?": null, "BINX: We don't abide by the formal titles. We're a house. We're a home.": null, "Andhera: Well, in that case, may I\u2014": null, "Omar: And I look around and I wanna say I grab like, a cardboard tube.": null, "Omar: And I hand it to you.": null, "Surena: Mm-hmm.": null, "Omar: And I kneel.": null, "Andhera: I pledge my oath to your cause. And let's bring this entire": null, "fucking thing down.": null, "Surena: And I, in remembering courtly things, like, I knight you and I": null, "say,": null, "BINX: Let's.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Oh my God, that's beautiful.": null, "[group applauding]": null, "Aabria: And we move from there and this moment. Can I ask above, is": null, "there anything Hob would wanna do before we get\u2014": null, "Brennan: Specifically? No.": null, "Aabria: Then we will sort of follow Captain Hob as he makes his way to": null, "the masquerade ball. You move down through the city and to another gate": null, "burrowed into that massive retaining wall. And you see it open up on": null, "another pocket dimension of grassy, fern-covered woods. And moving down": null, "into it, you see sunken in front of you, this beautiful, marble flooring": null, "dropped down. It's pretty, but it looks like a ruin, and you don't see": null, "anyone else there. It looks empty, but looks are deceiving, like a": null, "masquerade. And as you make your way through this little valley to get": null, "inside, the moment you cross the threshold, you are inside this massive,": null, "gilt building. There's gold and chandeliers hanging down and no sky": null, "overhead. The floor is that same beautiful marble, but it's covered with": null, "well-decorated\u2014": null, "The dome changes to be a projection of a ballroom similar to Aabria\u2019s": null, "description.": null, "Oscar: It's beautiful.": null, "Emily: Wow!": null, "Brennan: Wow, wow, wow.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you hear a full\u2014": null, "Lou: Do you see this?": null, "[elegant ballroom music]": null, "Aabria: You hear a full orchestra playing, and there are servants that": null, "are lesser Fey offering drinks and refreshments. And you are there, at a": null, "live, festive, popping ball. What is\u2014": null, "[Oscar beatboxing]": null, "Aabria: Yeah, we're gonna do a fit check for the squad. Let's start with": null, "Captain Hob.": null, "Brennan: Captain Hob, lowborn as he is, is dressed in the colors of the": null, "theme. Hob received a thing like\u2014": null, "[group chattering]": null, "Lou:\u00a0He\u2019s trying.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0He\u2019s trying!": null, "Brennan: This is literally like, most of the high\u2014but I think it's also": null, "because most of the highborn Fey are like, \"Oh, the theme is white and": null, "gold, so if I wanna make a splash, I should come wearing X.\"": null, "Brennan: And Hob is here in white and gold. He has a cream\u2014he looks like": null, "the architecture now.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Directions.": null, "Brennan: And Hob is doing this for two reasons. One, it occurred to him": null, "that he was like,": null, "Captain Hob: Well, oh, that's the theme, so that's probably required,": null, "mandatory.": null, "Brennan: And then someone was like, you know, \"It's not mandatory.\" And": null, "he was like,": null, "Captain Hob: Very well, it shall be an advantage should any stealth be": null, "required.": null, "Brennan: So he's wearing this beautiful, cream military coat with gold": null, "brocade, and a deep gold sash that runs across that he has rearranged": null, "all his medals on now that it's a new uniform, also to disguise that one": null, "of his medals is missing.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Aw.": null, "Brennan: He has his formal halberd with him that is a beautiful,": null, "ceremonial halberd. So the blade is an edge of fairy steel inlaid with": null, "platinum and ivory and little hints of gold in it. And he has his": null, "military cap that has a\u2014again, the tall, cavalry officer's cap that is": null, "again, cream, white with a golden bill and golden sort of, you know,": null, "plate here. And I think that the last bit of the fit is a tiny, golden": null, "chain going to a monocle.": null, "Brennan: And\u2014": null, "[Aabria squeals]": null, "Oscar: What, is that purely cosmetic, or was that\u2014?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Purely cosmetic.": null, "Oscar: I'm\u2014": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Purely cosmetic and\u2014": null, "Aabria: Oh, okay.": null, "Lou: He doesn't need it to see?": null, "Oscar: He don't need it!": null, "Brennan: I don\u2019t need it.\u00a0Oh, the sash is not straight like his normal": null, "red sash is. It's very, like, ruffled, and has folds to it, so he's": null, "hidden all his little potions in there.": null, "Brennan: And also he has white gloves that are sort of fitted where his": null, "claws burst out of the tip of them.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Go ahead and give me a Perception check as you arrive": null, "and scan the crowd.": null, "Brennan: Oh, 7.": null, "Aabria: Okay. You're not super aware of like, other people, but in a new": null, "environment, default to the basics. Where are the exits and where are my": null, "people? So you very quickly spot Boil and Blemish, who arrived a little": null, "bit before you. They're wearing deep green, and you see them walking": null, "with Lady Sylmenar, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Titania of the Seelie": null, "Court. And attendants of the Seelie Court are kind of walking back and": null, "forth and conferring with them and taking off in other directions. And": null, "you make eye contact with both Boil and Blemish and they give you a very": null, "respectable, but non-invitation nod and curtsy and bow and sort of move": null, "forward, continuing their talks.": null, "Captain Hob: My Lord and Lady.": null, "Brennan: And I will retreat and go stand by the punch bowl.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Let's get, hey, Lady Chirp Featherfowl.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Yeah?": null, "Aabria: As you rock up, what's you wearing, girl?": null, "Emily: I think I've used Fabricate to make a dress entirely of masks.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Ooh!": null, "Aabria: Shut up.": null, "Surena: Incredible.": null, "Emily: Now I need to ask you a question.": null, "Emily: For a bit. How long does Invoke Duplicity last?": null, "Aabria: In this instance, it will only be five minutes.": null, "Emily: Okay. That's not worth carrying my train. I will\u2014": null, "Lou: A second you.": null, "Aabria: Oh my God!": null, "Emily: I really wanted to be a second me carrying my train. [laughs]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I don't know, that's good for an entrance.": null, "Lou: A feathery entrance.": null, "Oscar: The second you could carry the train and then\u2014": null, "Emily: But I can also do Unseen Servant, AKA Unseen Bird-vant.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0No!": null, "Emily: To carry my train.": null, "Emily: So I'll just do that. And then I think, like,": null, "Chirp: Cousin, I think you understand my conflict with\u2014": null, "Squak: I mean, of course.": null, "Chirp: The idea of closing off the Material Plane.": null, "Squak: All of that good-good just on the other side of the portal.": null, "Chirp: That good-good, indeed.": null, "Oscar: I hate that.": null, "Chirp: And, I mean, it would be a loss for you as well. You'd never meet": null, "your niece.": null, "Squak: I would never get to get blackout drunk with my niece.": null, "Chirp: Again, we just have to wait a little bit longer.": null, "Squak: So are we wearing royal blue or are we not? Because I have": null, "decisions I need\u2014": null, "Chirp: There is a royal blue mask in here, but it\u2019s\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "Squak: We'll do a very small thing. A small thing. So no strawberry.": null, "Chirp: Okay. I'm saying like, I'm not on board with this, but are we": null, "stringing them along?": null, "Squak: I mean, of course we're stringing them along.": null, "Chirp: Okay, but\u2014": null, "Emily:\u00a0I affix a little strawberry.": null, "Squak: I'm all about the string, all right? I don't care what's at the": null, "other end of it.": null, "Squak: It's the string I love.": null, "Emily: Yeah. So we dress accordingly and I've done all my bullshit. I'm": null, "assuming you don't want me to walk you through all the different spells": null, "I've cast on myself?": null, "Aabria: Look, when it comes up, I will assume you've done your homework.": null, "Emily: Great, I did all my math.": null, "Aabria: I can like, see notes written from there and I'm like, yeah, I'm": null, "not gonna check your work. You did it. [laughs]": null, "Emily: Yeah, that's me.": null, "Aabria: Perfect. Okay, well\u2014": null, "Emily: And as much as I wanna Invoke Duplicity to have myself carrying": null, "my own train, I gotta save that shit. Oh, but I will take, though, the": null, "potion that gives me advantage on Performance checks.": null, "Aabria: Love that, cool. What you rocking up in, Squak?": null, "Lou: All white.": null, "Lou: I think it's all waistcoat, cravat, fucking trousers, coat. All": null, "white. And then instead of my normal black cape, it's a cape of literal": null, "molten gold\u2014": null, "[group moaning]": null, "Lou: That I think leaves ethereal, golden drops behind me that then": null, "disappear after a moment. But it's literally\u2014I'm dripping.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's so fucking cool.": null, "Lou: But yes, in all the white, I have one cufflink that is a royal blue": null, "stone and one cuff link that is a strawberry.": null, "Aabria: Oh, that's so good.": null, "Oscar: Why haven't y'all been doing fit checks since day one?": null, "Lou: We've been dressing reasonably, you know? And I am going to bring": null, "my two charm potions. And when I walk in, I'm going to cast Polymorph on": null, "one of the attendants.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, good.": null, "Lou: And turn them into a little salmon.": null, "Lou: And then, the other one, I'm then going to lean in and say,": null, "Squak: If you don't want the same thing to happen to you, you're not": null, "going to mention this.": null, "Lou: And I'm gonna take one of the love potions that I have and just": null, "drop it into another one of the glasses on the serving tray, shatter the": null, "thing.": null, "Squak: Have a great night.": null, "Aabria: Intimidation check.": null, "Lou: Of course. Happily.": null, "Aabria: It's fun, 'cause like, the attendants are largely Court of Sea": null, "Foam and they're like, \"I mean, being a fish isn't terrible, but I don't": null, "want it, not now.\"": null, "Lou: 24.": null, "Aabria: Why am I rolling? Yeah, okay. This person just\u2026 [long pause] and": null, "you see them blink, and like a second blink, a second set of eyelids,": null, "and they're like, \"I didn't see shit.\" And they just turn and walk away.": null, "Lou: But yeah, there's just one of them, somebody tonight is falling in": null, "love.": null, "Aabria: Love that.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Ooh, ooh.": null, "Emily: And I do have my African Grays on me, just for the record.": null, "Aabria: Perfect. Amazing. We come around to Rue.": null, "Oscar: Yes. So I would like to come in with Wuvvy, like, both of us": null, "coming in together.": null, "Oscar: And we're both wearing complementary outfits to each other.": null, "Whatever I wear, Wuvvy's wearing. I'm wearing all black, an entirely": null, "beautiful, black ball gown from head to toe. So Wuvvy's wearing all": null, "white.": null, "Oscar: Same design. Cascading down the bust area, all the way down to": null, "the end of the train, are just dyed black peonies.": null, "Oscar: And so, Wuvvy's also wearing white peonies. And then in the": null, "bottom, the underskirt is made out of liquid material in honor of the": null, "Sea Foam Court. So as I'm gliding down the ball, it looks as if I'm": null, "floating on water, surfing, if you will.": null, "Emily: Wow.": null, "Aabria: Surfboard.": null, "Oscar: Yes, there is a peony crown on the top of my head, and adorned": null, "around my neck is the only subtle white that I'm wearing, which is a": null, "pearl necklace. And I'm wearing a gold ring as well. It's massive,": null, "'cause I have giant claws.": null, "Oscar: Inside the ring, there is the medal of courage that Hob gave me,": null, "concealed for no one to see.": null, "Aabria: That's so good. Amazing. Gimme an Insight check for Wuvvy.": null, "Oscar: Hmm, okay. 16.": null, "Aabria: You know her very well, and, obviously, this being like one of": null, "these center points and one of the climaxes of the Bloom, she is notably": null, "and reasonably like harried, trying to get everything set up and ready": null, "to go. But even now, as everything is in place, and really whatever is": null, "gonna happen is going to happen, she still seems a little quiet. Not": null, "unpleasant, but just a little more reserved and standoffish than normal.": null, "Oscar: Mm-hmm. I mean, I do want to address and say,": null, "Rue: Wuvvy, I\u2014is everything alright? I know that there's much to be": null, "done, and thank you so much for entertaining me on this grand entrance.": null, "Wuvvy: Thank you. This is\u2014it's very nice to be able to walk beside you,": null, "um\u2026 I'm good, thank you.": null, "Rue: Wuvvy, if there's anything, of course, you know.": null, "Wuvvy: Thanks. Yeah, I know. This is good. We're good. This is": null, "beautiful. You did a great job.": null, "Aabria: And she\u2014": null, "Oscar: Then I let it go.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. She lingers for like a moment too long, also, and then": null, "turns and continues and moves out to like check on things so you can": null, "enjoy the night. And finally, BINX.": null, "Surena: BINX\u00a0is wearing a black, velvet dress that was taken from a": null, "curtain. So, you know, like those heavy curtains?": null, "Surena: She created a very, like, slinky dress that has a very, like,": null, "high slit. And across her chest are different objects, some of them toy,": null, "some of them lost jewelry, some of them broken pieces of glass. That's": null, "sort of like a, almost\u2014these objects are adhered to look almost like": null, "feathers. So they're just like very placed. She has a hood, and then the": null, "hood kind of is in the shape of like, owlbear ears.": null, "Surena: And she has a gold mask that is made of keys that has a beak.": null, "Brennan: Oh.": null, "Aabria: That's so cool. Amazing. And as you move down and in, you notice": null, "that you are being noticed.": null, "Aabria: Those who didn't sort of witness your arrival at an earlier": null, "event, everyone is here now.": null, "Aabria: And you hear whispers about the Weaver of Fate and the last of": null, "the Court of Craft, but all of that kind of falls away as you feel a": null, "taste that begins in the back of your throat and moves across your": null, "tongue. Sensation and flavor together, a fizzing bitterness that you": null, "recognize is the call of one of your warlocks.": null, "Surena: So I make my entrance and I immediately run to the restroom.": null, "Brennan: Hob's like,": null, "Captain Hob: I get it. Honestly, I get nervous making a big entrance,": null, "too. Yeah, for sure.": null, "Oscar: Someone's saying, \"Excuse me, you're in the front of the punch": null, "bowl.\"": null, "Captain Hob: Oh, sorry.": null, "Brennan: I just start ladling for people.": null, "Captain Hob: I think they think I work here.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Yeah, so you sprint for a bathroom.": null, "Aabria: What do you do?": null, "Surena: Is it a private bathroom? Is it like\u2014I mean, in my mind, I'm": null, "picturing a regular bathroom.": null, "Aabria: It is a regular bathroom, yeah.": null, "Surena: Thank you, cool. I whip out my magnifying glass and I go,": null, "BINX: Hello?": null, "Aabria: Yeah. And you see a little like, ochre-colored Kobold pop into": null, "frame, like eyeball first, and then backs up like,": null, "[whimsical orchestral music]": null, "Kobold: Hey. Hey.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Hey.": null, "Kobold: Hi, BINX. You look cool. What's up?": null, "BINX: What up? No, you. Hi, Scratch, what's up?": null, "Scratch:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "BINX: What do you need?": null, "Scratch: I just wanted to check in. It's been a while.": null, "BINX: How are you? Are you okay? Are you safe?": null, "Scratch: Um\u2026 Okay, no, I'm gonna be very honest.": null, "BINX: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Scratch: So\u2026": null, "Aabria: And you see that whatever sort of object is allowing him to see": null, "you as well, he kind of turns it over his shoulder as this massive,": null, "swirling darkness is devastating what looks like a small, like, hamlet": null, "of like thatched-roofed, little homes.": null, "[intense instrumental music]": null, "Scratch: Anyway, this is\u2014there\u2019s a\u2014[laughs] I'm with some friends and,": null, "hey, I\u2014there's a thing. It's invisible and killing everyone.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Oh my God.": null, "Scratch: Do you have any advice on how to kill it?": null, "BINX: It's invisible and it's killing everyone?": null, "BINX: All right.": null, "Scratch: I burned one of my spell slots. It's an invisible stalker. What": null, "is that and how do you do a hit to it?": null, "Scratch: I'm just looking for some advice. I got like six seconds.": null, "BINX: Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay, so\u2014": null, "Surena: I'm gonna assess him to see, like, if I can grant him extra": null, "power.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, okay. Give me an Arcana check.": null, "Surena: Okay. Oh buddy. Oh, oh, oh! That is a 22.": null, "Surena: Okay?": null, "Aabria: Amazing. The feeling you get from him as you look at him and": null, "kind of look him over, and then look him over with like your Arcane": null, "Eyes, you see that he has taken some damage already.": null, "Aabria: He's already scuffed up. And he seems to look low on magic. Like": null, "those low, small spells that you can cast forever, Cantrips, are still": null, "available to him, but he seems to be out of his big guns.": null, "Surena: So in seeing that, and seeing that he is in dire need of help, I": null, "take off my mask and I concentrate very, very hard. And I take the craft": null, "magic that I use to create this mask and I give it to him. And so what": null, "that looks like is, I know that it's six seconds, so if everything is\u2014": null, "Aabria: Oh, we're doing this in D&D bullet time.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria: Which is like 20 minutes for six seconds.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Great, great, great, great, great.": null, "Aabria: It's like a football game.": null, "Surena: But it starts to become fuzzy, like out of focus. And then I put": null, "it into my wing and I do my best to grant him another spell slot.": null, "Aabria: Let's make this a die roll.": null, "Aabria: And I'm gonna let you tell me what you're rolling to do this.": null, "Surena: Okay. Oh boy, I'm gonna be rolling\u2014": null, "Aabria: The DC is going to be 20.": null, "Aabria: To send him one spell slot. 25 to refresh everything on him.": null, "Aabria: And give him the effect of a short rest. And if you hit a 30,": null, "something else. You could always burn a token.": null, "Lou: For Scratch?": null, "Oscar: How many tokens you got?": null, "Surena: I have three.": null, "Lou: Is he worth it?": null, "Oscar: For Scratch?": null, "Lou: For Scratch.": null, "Oscar: For fan favorite, Scratch?": null, "Surena: For fan favorite, Scratch.": null, "Lou: For beloved, 8-season-long-arc-ing Scratch?": null, "Emily: Who is Scratch?": null, "Lou: You don't know Scratch?": null, "Lou: That's his catch phrase, number one.": null, "Aabria: It is!": null, "Lou: Yeah.": null, "Oscar: You don't know Scratch?": null, "Emily:\u00a0You don't know Scratch!": null, "Lou: Well, cause he's always in the other room.": null, "Lou: It's his thing.": null, "Surena: I'm going to burn this feather ,and I think it's because I": null, "obtained it while, as Gwyndolin\u2014": null, "Surena: And I don't feel like it was rightfully\u2014I mean, it was earned,": null, "but it wasn\u2019t\u2014it was myself being somebody else to earn it.": null, "Surena: So I'm burning this to send my magic to Scratch.": null, "Aabria: You hold your mask.": null, "[focused instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: And it goes fuzzy. And you actually feel something come away": null, "from it as this feather drops.": null, "Aabria: And you feel the great and powerful magic that a token holds,": null, "this small nexus of arcane. And you tuck it into your wing.": null, "Aabria: And you see Scratch's wounds begin to close.": null, "Aabria: And he kind of flexes, and you see the aura around him glow": null, "brighter again as he's like,": null, "Scratch: Hey, I think I'm back in it.": null, "BINX: Hey, you look great!": null, "Scratch: Thanks! You're so good at this. Any final advice? I gotta go.": null, "My turn's up in a sec.": null, "BINX: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Smoke, sand. If it's invisible, smoke and sand.": null, "Scratch: That's great.": null, "Scratch: All right, fog cloud coming in. Thanks, boo.": null, "Aabria: He like, tucks it.": null, "Brennan: This fall, the CW.": null, "Lou: You don't know?": null, "Brennan: It's a really young, attractive Kobold.": null, "Lou: What'd you say? You don't know Scratch? And that's most of the": null, "scenes.": null, "Omar:\u00a0He sounds like it's available.": null, "Aabria: And you make your way from this and back out, and realize that": null, "everyone at the masquerade is waiting for you.": null, "Aabria: Because as the holder of the crystal heart, no one gets to": null, "dance\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Until you open the floor.": null, "Surena: I have responsibilities!": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Squak:\u00a0Where the hell is BINX?": null, "Oscar: Whoops!": null, "Chirp: Yeah, I mean, I really like her but\u2014": null, "Squak: I wanna dance!": null, "Chirp: Maybe she's being fashionably late. She is very fashionable.

To the jewelers, hmm?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0To the jewelers.": null, "Emily: Oh my God.": null, "Oscar: Something to go get your pit stop on.": null, "Omar: Were I wearing my glasses, Oscar, I would blush so much.": null, "Omar: I approach as everyone's kind of, you know, trailing in, the Court": null, "of Tricksters.": null, "Omar: I go to the Trickster Court, and the way I approach them\u2014": null, "Omar: Because anytime you approach them, they're always doing little": null, "tricks.": null, "Aabria: They're always doing little tricks.": null, "Omar: My face falls into the familiar stature that I had before I even": null, "came to the Bloom.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Mm.": null, "Andhera: I've come to offer something. I've come to offer something.": null, "Aabria: So you walk up and you see Fable.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Mm-hmm.": null, "Aabria: The leader of the Trickster Court is a red haired man with his": null, "feet on backwards.": null, "Omar: Mm.": null, "[Brennan gasping]": null, "Aabria: And he's leaning in and speaking conspiratorially to none other": null, "than Viscountess Grabalba.": null, "Andhera: Viscountess, good to see you again.": null, "Aabria: And she gives you a little look like, \"This is embarrassing.": null, "What are you doing?\"": null, "Andhera: [laughs] But a moment of your time, I assure you. I was hoping": null, "to come into the possession of two items. One item, but two of them,": null, "that I will be passing on as gifts later this evening.

Tell me what you want.": null, "Andhera: Hmm. Actually, humiliation.": null, "Fable: Oh, now we're speaking the language that I love. Tell me more,": null, "young man.": null, "Andhera: I will tell you exactly what I wish. You will have to nab them": null, "from the Court of Wonder, but I suppose they're all so occupied with": null, "that huge ball.": null, "Fable: [groans] A struggle, to be sure.": null, "Andhera: And what a hilarious event it would be were things to go": null, "incredibly wrong. Am I right?": null, "Fable: I have to ask, young prince.": null, "Andhera:\u00a0Mm?": null, "Fable: What have I done to deserve such a gift?": null, "Andhera: [laughs] It's just part of something I'm doing.": null, "Omar: He just like, smirks.": null, "Fable: All right, keep your secrets.": null, "Fable:\u00a0Let me know what you have in mind.": null, "Andhera: Tokens.

You can": null, "feel it across your skin. He's analyzing the thousands upon thousands of": null, "permutations of possibilities that can be wrought with this.

And, Viscountess, you're looking so nasty tonight. I just": null, "wanna say, so nasty. You look filthy tonight.": null, "Andhera: Look at you.": null, "Grabalba: Stop that!": null, "Andhera: I have to leave, so nasty.": null, "Omar: And as I make my way, I keep glancing back and I'm just like,": null, "Andhera: So nasty.": null, "Grabalba: Oh my God, I\u2019m so sorry.": null, "Andhera: Do you see this? Do you see how nasty she's being tonight?": null, "Aabria: She's just glowing and beaming as she falls back into": null, "conversation with Fable. And then we move to the ball.

What? Wait, what?": null, "Rue: [whispering] Your responsibility.": null, "BINX: I have to dance?": null, "Brennan: Can I turn to Andhera as BINX is having this interaction with": null, "Rue?": null, "Omar: Mm-hmm.": null, "Captain Hob: [sighs] Brother?": null, "Andhera: Hm?": null, "Captain Hob: Are you gonna marry Grabalba, for real?": null, "Captain Hob: Someone's gotta.

I thought I was doing something. I wasn't doing": null, "anything.": null, "Andhera: Okay.": null, "Captain Hob: Please, do, do, do. And the dance is, [hands clapping]": null, "strike up the band!": null, "Surena: BINX\u00a0is in the middle of the dance floor and she only knows a": null, "couple of dances. And so she's gonna try to attempt solo the cha cha": null, "slide.": null, "Surena: And so she screams,": null, "BINX: Everybody, clap your hands! [claps]": null, "[group clapping]": null, "[violin music]": null, "Surena: And then she starts\u2026": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BINX does the cha cha slide.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Oof.": null, "Chirp: Beautiful.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna need a Persuasion check with disadvantage.": null, "Emily: Can I have my African Grays, which have a language of 800 to": null, "1,000 words, can I just have them fly about, twittering, \"Beautiful!": null, "Amazing! Fantastic! Irreverent!\"": null, "Aabria: Okay, I'll cancel the disadvantage.": null, "Emily:\u00a0\"Unexpected!\"": null, "Aabria: [laughing] Unexpected! It's so good.": null, "Surena: Persuasion, oh, 25.": null, "Aabria: Okay. People are slow to like, pick up your vibe. The birds, for": null, "sure, help. And they're like, \"Yeah, that sounds like a\u2014I'm not gonna": null, "look up, that would be crazy. But, yeah, if other people think that this": null, "is great\u2014\"": null, "Aabria: \u201cI think it's great.\u201d And slowly get into it and are clapping": null, "along. And after like the first 30 seconds of the cha cha slide, they": null, "join you.": null, "Squak: It seems like an incredibly simple dance. We could do it.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Absolutely!": null, "Squak: It seems to be one to the left.": null, "Chirp: Uh huh.": null, "Squak: And then we take it back now, y'all.": null, "Chirp: Yeah!": null, "Squak: Now one hop this time? Okay, one more hop this time.": null, "Chirp: Okay!": null, "Squak: Yes, slide to the right! Slide to the left!": null, "Captain Hob: I wish all dances came with instructions in the lyrics.": null, "Squak: Everybody clap your hands! [hands clapping] In sixteenths!": null, "Aabria: Amazing. And it has begun sort of proper. So now that the floor": null, "has been opened, beyond this first sort of dance, you are released. You": null, "can stay dancing. You can go find friends and have conversation, but": null, "I'll sort of open it up to the group. What's everyone's priorities in": null, "this moment?": null, "Oscar: I beeline my way towards Lady Featherfowl.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Ah.": null, "Oscar: Are you amongst a lot of people at this moment in time?": null, "Emily: Just a lot of birds. I am on an ostrich being carried by\u2014": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Are you on an ostrich?": null, "Emily: Doves. Oh, actually, I don't have Flock of Familiars for doves,": null, "so just the ostrich, with a bunch of African Grays on my arm who are": null, "smoking cigars. They've developed a taste for it, you naughty babies.": null, "Rue: Lady Featherfowl?": null, "Chirp: Ah, Rue.": null, "Rue: Hello.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Hi.": null, "Rue: I\u2013": null, "Chirp: Are you enjoying the party so far? I thought the group dance was": null, "inspired.": null, "Rue: Oh, yeah, well, that had nothing to do with me, and everything to": null, "do with the wonderful BINX.": null, "Chirp: The Lady BINX, yes.": null, "Rue:\u00a0Yes, absolutely.": null, "Chirp: She's quite the charmer.": null, "Rue: And I did notice the birds that you sent along to help the": null, "situation. So thank you for that.": null, "Chirp: Ah, yes, of course. Well, they can speak 800 to 1,000 words.": null, "Rue: These smoking parrots?": null, "Chirp: Well, if they smoke too much, they might not be able to anymore.": null, "Rue: Lady Featherfowl, I must say that I apologize for my delay in": null, "getting back to you.": null, "Chirp: Ah, the salt Goblins that I sent to you with the illusory script.": null, "Yes, don't worry. I figured it all out.": null, "Chirp: I was in need of a question relating to the wager, and I figured": null, "it all out.": null, "Rue: I have to apologize. The wager was a moment. I seem to have": null, "forgotten all about it. It's been a very wild Bloom for me, personally,": null, "but\u2014": null, "Chirp: Yes, yes. I've enjoyed seeing you take a little more time to": null, "Rue:\u00a0Thank you.": null, "Chirp: I hope that's coming from a good place?": null, "Rue: Yes, it is.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Good.": null, "Rue: Thank you. And, again, for the Archfey for just seeing me for who I": null, "am truly means a lot. But I did want to ask you, I was curious\u2014": null, "Chirp: Oh, yes, I\u2014": null, "Rue: And I speak to you as a friend. How is your adventures in finding": null, "love? Has that been fruitful?": null, "Chirp: Ah. You know, I do find myself in love. It's hard for a bird to": null, "fall, [chuckles] 'cause we have wings, but I do. So in terms of falling": null, "in love\u2014but I do find myself in love, so thank you.": null, "Rue: So the wager has been met?": null, "Chirp: The wager? Uh, the wager?": null, "Rue: Is it love?": null, "Chirp: I do feel love in my heart.": null, "Rue: Is it reciprocated?": null, "Chirp: It is reciprocated.": null, "Rue: Was there any aid of magic at all?": null, "Chirp: No, there was not. It was quite an unexpected love that I did not": null, "expect.": null, "Oscar: And then I, breaking any sort of like, traditional to-dos, I like": null, "rush over to Featherfowl and I give her a big hug.": null, "Chirp: Thank you, wow.": null, "Rue:\u00a0I'm so proud of you.": null, "Chirp: Well,\u00a0I'm so proud of you. And what for you? I mean, if this is": null, "the last Bloom, I know that you have turned down\u2014I've heard the rumors": null, "you've turned down so many proposals.": null, "Chirp: Is there any consideration in you that, being the last Bloom,": null, "that you might indulge yourself in something you've previously denied": null, "yourself?": null, "Rue: Oh, it's not about denial. There's just so much to do at the Bloom.": null, "The Bloom isn't about me. I guess\u2014": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Well\u2014": null, "Rue: It became about me. [laughs]": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rue:\u00a0It\u2019s, uh\u2014[stammering]": null, "Chirp: I think any time it's about you, it has been delightful.": null, "Rue:\u00a0Mm.": null, "Chirp: That dramatic duel was fantastic.": null, "Rue: Yes, about that. I'm remembering that the formal duel sent by birds": null, "was written out that it was Hob against Rue's assistant.": null, "Chirp: Right.

[huffs mask]": null, "Lou: And I think, each wearing half a mask, we're gonna go talk to": null, "Grandfather. Oh, and as we walk over, I put a reassuring hand on Chirp's": null, "shoulder and go,": null, "Squak: We got this. We've been drunker in even more important situations": null, "before.": null, "Chirp: You\u2019re\u00a0totally right.

You make your way over to your grandfather, who is": null, "standing in just sort of an ivory suit with a cape that's encrusted with": null, "amethyst at the shoulder and down the breast. But his skin looks sort of": null, "sallow and grayish by comparison. He's got like, a little snood hanging": null, "over, of skin. Look, he's the worst part of birds, and that's basically": null, "everything, you know, on a turkey, he's rocking, 'cause they're a yucky": null, "bird.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria: And he's just sort of standing there.": null, "Emily: Is he drinking something?": null, "Aabria: He actually has a stemless flute in his hand. And you see as his": null, "hand kind of goes over it, it goes from like a transparent, thin glass": null, "and frosts over in gold, so you can't see what's inside of it.": null, "Chirp: Grandfather, this is the climax to which you referred?": null, "Grandfather: Mm-hmm.": null, "Squak: It is so good to see you.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0It's so good to see you.": null, "Lou: I'll bow low.": null, "Aabria: He gives a little bow back.": null, "Chirp: Ah, I think that you'll find that we've negotiated two fantastic": null, "matches, and you can witness us being next to them tonight.": null, "Squak: Yes, we can play a fun game where we'll go stand next to them.": null, "Squak: As it hasn't been\u2014Grandfather, as you know, things are courtly": null, "and it's all delicate.": null, "Chirp: It's all delicate, so it's not set in stone right now\u2014": null, "Chirp: To borrow the phrase from the Stone Court.": null, "Grandfather:\u00a0Hm.": null, "Chirp: Ah, I made Grandfather laugh. Okay, um, so, but you know, you can": null, "kind of witness the very beginnings.": null, "Grandfather: Show me.": null, "Emily: I look for Suntar and I point at her.": null, "Grandfather: Really?": null, "Chirp: It is in the works.": null, "Lou: I'm going to point at both the Baroness and Apollo.": null, "Squak: Do you have a preference?": null, "Aabria: God, what is the flex check on that? Just gimme just a raw": null, "Charisma roll.": null, "Aabria: That's wild.": null, "Oscar: Nat 20, please.": null, "Lou: No, only a 10.

You got": null, "this honest.": null, "Squak: Grandfather, you seem to be a bit underdressed.": null, "Squak: You're lacking a mask.": null, "Aabria: No!": null, "Chirp: Yes, Grandfather! Go ahead and try it on.": null, "Squak: Here, grandfather, throw that on there.": null, "Aabria: You gotta give a me persuasion check.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Oh God.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Aabria: With advantage, 'cause you're both doing it.": null, "Lou: Great. Oh, first one is a 10 for 21.": null, "Lou: Second one\u2026 is a 14 for 25.": null, "Chirp: Here, I'll hold your drink while you put the mask on.": null, "Aabria: He hands off the drink.": null, "Emily: And I'll dump a love potion into it.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Stop!": null, "Aabria: Yes!": null, "Oscar: Stop it, stop it!": null, "Aabria: Look, that's dope. I'm not making you roll for it.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Aabria: The mask goes on. You watch his beady, terrible eyes dilate.

I'll make a Stealth roll,": null, "whatever you need me to do.": null, "All:\u00a0Grabalba! Grabalba! Grabalba! Grabalba! Grabalba! Grabalba!": null, "Emily: Oh my God, what if\u2014": null, "Brennan: Can we clock this? Can I huck Grabalba right at Grandfather?": null, "Aabria: Throw her! Grandfather's eye line slides and slides in a": null, "direction. He goes,": null, "Grandfather: I actually have to go see... Dismissed.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Of course.": null, "Chirp: Okay, Grandfather, of course. Of course.": null, "Aabria: And as he pushes past you, very excitedly moving in the": null, "direction of some members of the Sea Foam Court, he says,": null, "Grandfather: Brunch tomorrow.": null, "Squak: Oh, right. Brunch with Grandfather.": null, "Aabria: And moves through. And you all suddenly hear like a thunderclap,": null, "a loud bang, and the illusory walls around you begin to fall away,": null, "starting from the ground and moving up until the ceiling is gone and you": null, "see the sky overhead.": null, "The dome projects fireworks in the background.": null, "[group oohing] [fireworks exploding] [group applauding]": null, "Aabria: As a beautiful fireworks show begins and very much in the way": null, "that Lady Chirp mentioned this added darkness, this openness, this": null, "transformation to just the cover of night and everything that happens": null, "under a sky, inhibitions are lost, and the Fey truly have moments under": null, "booms and sighs and ahhs to be themselves. And very much in the manner": null, "of the Hedge Maze, I wanna ask you all one more time under the cover of": null, "darkness with flashes of light, where do each of you move? You have one": null, "more moment here at the masquerade. Captain Hob?": null, "Brennan: We have one more moment in the masquerade before the night": null, "descends and the fireworks begin?": null, "Brennan: Does this mean that we have one more moment of feeling": null, "ourselves as we did when masked and formal?": null, "Aabria: I think it's sort of in that like, transition period, as things": null, "move from like, one phase to the next, everyone, like, there's a sudden": null, "surge of motion as people sort of realign their efforts, and you see": null, "people like, scampering into the woods and disappearing into the": null, "darkness. So what do you do in this moment of transition as the": null, "masquerade falls away?": null, "Brennan: Oscar, you wanna call odds or evens?": null, "Oscar: I'm gonna say odds.": null, "Brennan: Never been happier to roll a nat 1.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooh!": null, "Oscar: You rolled a nat 1?": null, "Omar: I watched it!": null, "Brennan: I rolled a nat 1. Hob has been eyeing Apollo all night,": null, "preparing for the moment to reach out and strike, to begin this duel.": null, "And I think he's also been looking at the Lords of the Wing, thinking to": null, "himself, \"I'm going to give the Lord of Peckersburg and the Lady of": null, "Cluckingham exactly what they want, which is some action.\" And the first": null, "[fireworks exploding] goes off in the air, the first loud noise. And I": null, "think there's just enough of a gasp of people that were not expecting": null, "this, a little bit of startledness and a little bit of surprise, that": null, "Hob has always looked at his core and said, \"Well, I'm a Goblin. I'm": null, "ferocious, I'm terrifying.

And I look at my own": null, "brown, furry claws, with similar claws to yours.": null, "Brennan: Mm-hmm.": null, "Oscar: And I have never felt more appreciative of\u2014because, you know, I": null, "would have normally put on a glamor to this event, but seeing my claws": null, "and his claws together, I realize that I am not alone. I'm not the only": null, "one.

I'm quite fine.": null, "Captain Hob: Oh no, I understand. They startled me as well. My action": null, "was not a reflection on your startlement, but my own. You look": null, "resplendent.": null, "Rue: I was going to say the exact same thing. You look divine.": null, "Captain Hob: As full as I am sure your dance card must be, um\u2026 Sorry,": null, "no, I meant only to mention your\u2014I'm sure you must be being bothered by": null, "everyone asking you to dance.": null, "Rue: Captain Hob, look around you. Who?": null, "Brennan: Do I look at your dance card and not see any names on it?": null, "Oscar: Mm-hmm.": null, "Captain Hob: Might I have the honor of inscribing my name upon your": null, "card?": null, "Rue: That would please me greatly.": null, "Captain Hob: There have been many instances that led me to believe that": null, "here amongst these Fey, I might at times have been surrounded by fools.": null, "Seeing that I have beat them all to the most desirable card in the room,": null, "I've never been more certain.": null, "Brennan: And I write my name on your dance card and I bow.": null, "Rue: Now let's take a look at your dance card.": null, "Captain Hob: Oh, [laughing] somewhat empty as well.": null, "Rue: Well, may I?": null, "Oscar: And then I start to write my name on your dance card.": null, "Rue: If the Archfey at this ball are blind, they are also foolish for": null, "not seeing the true magnificence of a gentleman amongst gentlemen": null, "Brennan: I look at my card. I fold it, meet your gaze, and I eat it.": null, "[hands clapping] [group laughing]": null, "Aabria: And we move from that to BINX. What do you do in this moment?": null, "Surena: So in this moment, I feel like BINX is not used to the glitz and": null, "the glam and the opulence of moments like this. And so, naturally, she": null, "is kind of drawn to the shadows and to darker corners. And so I think": null, "for a large majority of the dance, she's just been chatting with you.": null, "Surena: And just talking about everything. And then gives Andhera, tries": null, "to split a black apple with them and says,": null, "BINX: Have you tried these yet? They're amazing.": null, "Andhera: No. My dog had one of those the other day. I was so\u2014": null, "BINX: Wait, your dog ate\u2014": null, "Andhera: No, the dog just was around them.": null, "BINX: Oh. Uh, try it.": null, "Omar: And I take a bite of the half apple.": null, "Surena: Okay.": null, "Surena: Imbued in this apple are memories. They're memories of the": null, "Mortal Realm.
