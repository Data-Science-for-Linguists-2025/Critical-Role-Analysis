But that's": null, "okay.": null, "Aabria: Okay, it's fucked up you've now put that gauntlet on me. Someone": null, "hey, Schaubach, get me a thesaurus.": null, "Siobhan: She's gonna do a bad one for the next episode. So get ready.": null, "Aabria: It's gonna be a cuss.": null, "Brennan: Already a huge stroke of luck that stoats have two names.": null, "Already a huge--": null, "Aabria: Yeah.": null, "Erika: We've got Kingdom...": null, "Aabria: Phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. Let's go, baby!": null, "Izzy: I think next episode you should just say, \"Hey, bitches.\"": null, "Aabria: Yeah! Hey, mother fuckers, let's go! You're a bunch of rats.": null, "Well, previously on \"Burrow's End\" you all woke up again in the shadow": null, "of the great bear that you killed or put to rest. However you want to": null, "put it. Some of you moved through visions of the past and visions of the": null, "future of what could be and what might be. And all of it suffused in and": null, "around the idea of the Blue. You climbed a tree to get a vantage point": null, "on where you are and where you're headed. And you came across some": null, "writing. And figured out what writing is. And spontaneously manifested": null, "the ability to read!": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Woo!": null, "Aabria: Shout out to the Blue. You know that there are other stoats in": null, "these woods and they told you to trust your instincts and move towards": null, "the light. And you did, having a time to briefly come together forge": null, "your bonds, double down on the idea that you are your best understanding": null, "of \"us\" and that everyone else is \"them.\" You moved for days through": null, "these woods and finally find yourselves at the foot of a massive, rocky": null, "outcropping at the top of which is... of a massive, rocky outcropping at": null, "the top of which is... The word is a \"building,\" though that doesn't": null, "quite mean anything to you. This is the most tremendous and imposing": null, "burrow you've ever seen. And you know that this is where you are being": null, "led. So, my lovely little stoat family, what do you wanna do?": null, "Thorn: They built it above ground. That's a weird move. Ha, like a": null, "warren above ground? That's strange, right?": null, "Viola: I've only ever lived underground. Momma can we even live--": null, "Ava: It's simply not done, not possible.": null, "Thorn: Uh, well... It's uh...": null, "Jaysohn: But Grandma, the smoke went down, so maybe we should go up.": null, "Ava: All right, let's...": null, "Teedles: That's as good as you're gonna get.": null, "Thorn: Yep, okay.": null, "Viola: Well, it's a big rock. And we've seen rocks before. So what do we": null, "do to rocks? We jump off 'em?": null, "Teedles: Hey, hey.": null, "Viola: Mmm? (chuckling) Metaphor!": null, "Siobhan: Just grabbed by the back of the neck.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Just scruff hold. Can I get a batch of investigation": null, "checks from everyone?": null, "Brennan: Yes.": null, "Jasper: How about I go ahead and give Lila the help action.": null, "Aabria: A nat 20?": null, "Brennan: I hit a natural 20.": null, "Erika: Yeah!": null, "Aabria: Woo!": null, "Jasper: Feels right.": null, "Brennan: I hit a natural 20 for 19.": null, "Aabria: No!": null, "Brennan: It is a nat 20, but you know.": null, "Aabria: Some of us don't respect crits in this house. That's not me.": null, "Rashawn: 17.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] 17.": null, "Siobhan: Seven.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Perfect.": null, "Jasper: I was gonna give Lila the help action if possible.

What about that?": null, "Izzy: What's eight plus nine, 15?": null, "Izzy: 17.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] How'd you do, Ava?": null, "Erika: Seven.": null, "Aabria: Aw! Little family moment. All right, so we'll start with our": null, "natural 20 for a total of 19. As you sort of look at this rocky": null, "outcropping with something built above it, but also sort of in the base": null, "rock of it, a massive set of double doors sealed shut. What do you think": null, "Tula cares most about in sort of her first scan of this?": null, "Brennan: Tula has an eight intelligence, which I don't interpret as her": null, "not being bright. I interpret it as a negative relationship with": null, "curiosity writ large.": null, "Brennan: So I think that the reflection of this is that she has a plus": null, "10 to insight, so I think that she's actually regarding everything with": null, "soft eyes and just like, not focusing. I think she is, as ever, probably": null, "staying as non focused and broadly aware and always on the lookout for": null, "danger. Like, I am aware for danger. There's nothing I want to search": null, "for, because I want to trade that for being aware.": null, "Aabria: I love that. And the thing I will sort of give you in this as": null, "you sort of relax and try to take a holistic, unspecific understanding": null, "of this is, though you don't see any stoats right now, you are aware of": null, "like, the sort of gentle grade of paths in and around this place. So": null, "there are signs of life, though you do not see any stoats or any other": null, "animals right now.": null, "Tula: This place is an enormous warren. You can see,": null, "Brennan: and I just start pointing out,": null, "Tula:\u00a0look at all these pathways. They're hunting successfully around": null, "here. There's paths that, all the grass is pulled down in the same": null, "direction. Meaning things get carried in and nothing gets carried back": null, "out. You can see all of it. There's just a lot. There's a lot of stoats": null, "here.": null, "Thorn: Hm.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] 17, what does Lila care about in this moment as you're": null, "sort of first looking at everything?": null, "Lila: Um... I think... the Blue... is made here?": null, "Tula: Okay, well, you saw a blue sun here.": null, "Thorn: Mm.": null, "Tula:\u00a0There's lots of stoat paths all around here, which is better...": null, "I'll be honest, I think you all know that I was not the most excited to": null, "come here, but coming here and finding stoat paths is the most": null, "encouraging of what we could have found. There's not big bear tracks. So": null, "at least we know that there are many stoats who seem to be able to live": null, "in this place with Blue around it and I don't see signs of struggle or": null, "danger here.": null, "Ava: You're welcome. (Aabria chuckling)": null, "Viola: Yes, Mama, you did this.": null, "Jaysohn: Thanks, Grandma.": null, "Ava: Thank you.": null, "Aabria: Viola, where does your tension move as you sort of take this in": null, "and investigate it?": null, "Rashawn: Knowing that this is a warren, an above ground warren that's": null, "gotta be ways to get in. And so I'm ear to the earth of like listening": null, "for what could be rumbling underground or are there any like stoat": null, "holes, or are there holes that are bigger than us? Because that could": null, "mean something nasty.": null, "Aabria: Nice! So leaning into just, okay, here's what we see, what am I": null, "hearing?": null, "Izzy: Yeah, it could be a different animal.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, getting very low to the ground. You push your hearing, you": null, "push your smell and you hear it. You hear the scurrying that makes you": null, "think \"warren.\" But there is something... It's like the difference": null, "between like hearing clapping and hearing applause. Where the sound, in": null, "just the sheer magnitude of it, sounds different. And you're like, oh.": null, "Oh, it's just so many.": null, "Rashawn: So many and so far away? Or so many up close?": null, "Aabria: It's so many and it's deep. So you had that strong thing of": null, "like, the warren's up there. Where is everything else? And you realize": null, "as you're leaning in, oh, part of it's above ground. There is more": null, "below. Looking at the front there doesn't seem to be an obvious way in,": null, "that you'll have to look for a hole. Because if this is a bunch of": null, "stoats, they will have the same ideas that you do about like, hiding the": null, "entrance.": null, "Viola: I feel there are a lot. A lot of them in there. And either they": null, "could be our friends, or they could be bad. But there's a lot. A lot": null, "more of them then there are of us.": null, "Lila: Honestly, I think we should climb it.": null, "Tula: We have been in a lot of danger. And this is really encouraging": null, "that there are stoats here, but that doesn't mean we are out of danger.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, but I'm hungry.": null, "Tula: I know, sweetie.": null, "Aabria: You're hungry?": null, "Jaysohn: I'm hungry.": null, "Lila: Eat the building.": null, "Jaysohn: Are you telling me to bite a rock? That's not gonna work again.": null, "Lila: Your first instinct to bite something when you were hungry was": null, "really good.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, but like, it's a rock. And like, you've tricked--": null, "Lila: Bite the rock, Jaysohn.": null, "Viola: I don't think we should eat anything here.": null, "Jaysohn: I'm not stupid, Lila, I'm not gonna bite the rock.": null, "Lila: Again, you've done it before.": null, "Tula: Okay, okay, that's great.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, I'll bite the rock!": null, "Tula: No, that's not the conclusion. (crunch)": null, "Aabria: Do you bite a rock?": null, "Siobhan: I do bite a rock.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Ow! Ow! It's a rock!": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Give me a con save.": null, "Erika: [Erika] You've gotta not...": null, "Brennan: [Brennan] You get a nat one and lose your fangs.": null, "Siobhan: Con save?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yeah.": null, "Siobhan: A 13.": null, "Rashawn: Oh, add a plus two to that.": null, "Siobhan: Okay, 15.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] You feel like--": null, "Rashawn: My auntie arm goes, no!": null, "Erika: Auntie arm!": null, "Brennan: Paladin auras are just hands swatting.": null, "Aabria: The Mom arm is the strongest thing in existence. And I think the": null, "rock gets shoved just enough that you hear the beginning of like a": null, "little crack, but you don't feel any pain and all your teeth stay in": null, "your face.": null, "Jaysohn: It tastes bad. It tastes bad. It tastes like a rock.": null, "Tula: I know that I should hold your brother responsible for not biting": null, "rocks, but in actuality,": null, "Lila: Yeah, that one was me, I know.": null, "Tula: You need to stop asking your brother to bite rocks.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0": null, "Lila: I know, but the last time he was hungry it was really--": null, "Ava: He's gonna do anything that you tell him to do.": null, "Viola: To accommodate for how scared you are, I think that our first": null, "move should be something that you want to do, since you didn't want to": null, "come here at all.": null, "Tula: Thank you, Viola.": null, "Viola: I just want you to be comfortable. You can drive.": null, "Tula: To reflect that back to you, my instinct is you should lead the": null, "way into this next place. This is a dangerous situation we're in. Even": null, "if these stoats are very nice, a bunch of stoats showing up with no food": null, "that we've hunted, nothing to give is just six hungry mouths showing up": null, "at a warren.": null, "Lila: Should we get some presents?": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn, your mom is going on and droning and you're hungry and": null, "you bit a rock. You smell on the wind, there is meat, there is animal.": null, "You smell like fur and blood and things alive.": null, "Siobhan: I start floating off the ground following the scent.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yes!": null, "Erika: [Erika] Ha, ha, ha!": null, "Aabria: A full fuckin' Looney Tune, Jaysohn takes off.": null, "Siobhan: I just don't tell anyone and I just start wandering towards the": null, "smell.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Sure.": null, "Lila: Jaysohn is flying again.": null, "Thorn: I also agree that perhaps we should... Oh my! No, Jaysohn!": null, "Tula: Jaysohn!": null, "Thorn: Jaysohn!": null, "Jaysohn: They have food in there, come on, let's just go. I'm so hungry.": null, "Rashawn: I'm gonna full on, like Sophia in \"The Color Purple\", I'm like": null, "marching across in front of Jaysohn like, no. Don't you hurt my family!": null, "(chuckling) (marching grunts)": null, "Erika: So, with my seven that means I'm not as focused on what's going": null, "on there. I'm, you know, and my daughter makes a good point in that we": null, "should not go in empty handed. I'm not thinking about bringing presents.": null, "So I'm gonna look around here and I'm gonna see what else there is": null, "around here that could either be a show of good faith, or force.": null, "Lila: You have a lot of candy.": null, "Ava: I know. This is not, this is only grandchildren candy.": null, "Aabria: Grand candy.": null, "Erika: Grandy.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Grandy. There it is.": null, "Aabria: I think it's very obvious, even with a seven, like this area and": null, "the sort of last 10 minutes of your walk was not deforested. But you": null, "weren't walking past like bugs and animals and birds and nests. The": null, "immediate area around this is well trodden and well hunted already.": null, "Erika: But what is there that's not natural?": null, "Brennan: As I see you start to look around, I'm just going to go like,": null, "Tula:\u00a0Mama, we probably don't want to get them a gift from their own": null, "front yard.": null, "Ava: Maybe they just don't know how to use the gifts like we do.": null, "Aabria: But I will also say, that I like that idea of the symmetry of": null, "twin sevens. As you're looking around... As you're looking around for": null, "what's around here, you also smell it. Like an aggressive amount of": null, "living things. Of prey somewhere very close. But not within visual range": null, "right now.": null, "Izzy: Are there windows?": null, "Aabria: No.": null, "Izzy: Okay. Is there any way to see what's inside, not even a little": null, "bit?": null, "Aabria: You can get in there and try to, do you rock all the way up to": null, "the building right now? You're sort of down at the bottom of the rocky": null, "outcropping. It looks like it would probably be 100 meters to get up to": null, "the top building. Quarter of a football field straight just to get to": null, "the big double doors.": null, "Erika: And all of this is just fanciful interpretation of things. We": null, "don't necessarily see the things in there?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Correct, yeah.": null, "Jasper: I'm also, just to say, Jaysohn's still going. Viola's also still": null, "going.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Sure, sure, sure.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] I think maybe we just need to be on the, you know.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] As charming as you can be.": null, "Izzy: If we get closer we can maybe figure out what the danger is.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, I'm gonna run off after Jaysohn and I'm gonna say,": null, "Tula:\u00a0Lila, stay with Grandma.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And I will look over at Viola and say like,": null, "Tula:\u00a0Thorn has seen a lot of the world. I think that you two speaking": null, "on our behalf, a mother with hungry children and a grandma do not seem": null, "like great additions to a new warren if we are trying to make ourselves": null, "seem helpful.": null, "Thorn: Big stoat smiles, everyone.": null, "Rashawn: Are Olliver and Teedles with us?": null, "Aabria: Olliver and Teedles are with you. They've learned quite": null, "obviously to hang back. Your family, for all of its beautiful love and": null, "friendship, is not good at getting outside input.": null, "Rashawn: Fair. (chuckling)": null, "Izzy: Well, I forgot they were here.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yup.": null, "Rashawn: Cool, I guess I rock up. And to...": null, "Aabria: So Jaysohn is not headed toward the front door. I want to be": null, "very clear. Jaysohn, if you are following your (laughing) nose.": null, "Siobhan: Eyes closed.": null, "Aabria: Eyes closed, following your nose. You're actually being led up": null, "and around the rocky outcropping and you guys realize that you're": null, "following a path. I mean, he's not. He's floating three inches above the": null, "ground. But you are following a path, sort of circumnavigating this": null, "outcropping.": null, "Rashawn: I'm gonna cast Sanctuary on Jaysohn. This is auntie senses just": null, "putting that on you. Like, you're gonna go your own way but anybody who": null, "tries to funk with you has to make a wisdom saving throw first.": null, "Aabria: Did you say funk?": null, "Rashawn: Yes.": null, "Siobhan: [Siobhan] Very auntie.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Yes.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0(singing) No, no, no": null, "Jasper:\u00a0(continues singing) Don't funk my Jaysohn.": null, "Rashawn: Not gonna funk that up.": null, "Aabria: So my question in this is, is this just you being extra": null, "protective?": null, "Aabria: Or are you doing magic?": null, "Rashawn: No, this is being extra protective. As I'm with child and": null, "thinking, I'm a mother now. I'm just feeling a little bit more, not": null, "teetering on paranoid, of like, blinders are on, we have to look out for": null, "other people around me. Any action that I do will affect a lot more": null, "people than just, oh, Viola's just being nutty. So just to have a little": null, "bit of protection, because my sister sent me with her child. And then I": null, "guess I'll rock up to a stoat hole.": null, "Aabria: You don't see any yet.": null, "Rashawn: Okay.": null, "Jasper: If we're just on our way, I'll really quickly pivot to Teedles": null, "and say,": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Do you remember that time we got to the warren by the lake?": null, "Teedles: Yeah.": null, "Thorn: And I had to go in and do a lot of talking. And because I was": null, "talking, I couldn't really keep my head on a swivel?": null, "Thorn: Could you do the head on a swivel bit for me?": null, "Teedles: Yeah, (stammers) yeah.": null, "Thorn: Just.": null, "Teedles: I was gonna say something sarcastic, but this is weird, yeah.": null, "Thorn: This is weird.": null, "Teedles: Okay, cool.": null, "Thorn: But if you can, I think the main thing is we need to endear": null, "ourselves to these other stoats as quickly as possible. But obviously if": null, "you see anyone making any particular moves like, let us know, and": null, "quietly, I think, probably is best.": null, "Teedles: Understood.": null, "Brennan: If Jaysohn is splitting off, if we're headed towards the front": null, "door...": null, "Aabria: I'm trying to, yeah, I was just about to ask, like, who's going": null, "where?": null, "Brennan: Jaysohn has peeled off, But we want to head to the front door.": null, "Aabria: You two? (pointing to Brennan and Izzy)": null, "Brennan: I think. Or, I'm gonna try to wrangle Jaysohn to bring. I'm": null, "gonna let, I think, I'll look at Viola and say,": null, "Tula:\u00a0I think knocking on the front door is gonna be the most polite": null, "thing to do. I'll go grab Jaysohn and circle up if you wanna talk to": null, "them.": null, "Viola: Absolutely. We need to be a united front. Humility is the name of": null, "the game.": null, "Thorn: Mm-hm.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna run off to grab Jaysohn to join the rest of the": null, "family at the front door.": null, "Izzy: We also don't know what a door is.": null, "Siobhan: Also, good luck. My speed is 40.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna be real honest with you. Are you moving at your full": null, "speed?": null, "Siobhan: Yeah.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Yeah.": null, "Aabria: You're gonna struggle to catch your son.": null, "Thorn: I think we should just go with Jaysohn on this. Jaysohn has good": null, "instincts for this kind of thing and honestly, perhaps we show more": null, "stoat-like instincts if we go in through a stoat entrance, as opposed to": null, "whatever this is.": null, "Aabria: Do you want to try to stop Jaysohn? Because you're not gonna be": null, "able to catch him.": null, "Brennan: I will call out to my son.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Jaysohn! Please come back. Whatever you're smelling is not yours.": null, "Jaysohn: But the food is this way.": null, "Tula: Okay, if we're gonna go get food, we should all go together. We": null, "don't know who lives here.": null, "Izzy: Jaysohn there's a huge rock over here you could jump off of.": null, "Jaysohn: But I'm too hungry to even jump off a rock.": null, "Aabria: Ava, what are you doing in this moment?": null, "Erika: It always pays to follow the neurodivergent child. (laughing)": null, "Aabria: You do not know what a door is, but you get, you're like, I": null, "understand ADHD.": null, "Erika: Yes, yes, yes. So I go on with my grandson. You know, I think": null, "there is a family moment. I see that Jaysohn also has the idea I see": null, "that Jaysohn also has the idea of not going right up to the front door": null, "because you know, I've been at war before with other stoats and you just": null, "gotta keep track of all the different holes in the warren, you know?": null, "Brennan: You have to- Okay.": null, "Viola: So, should we even tell them that we have our full numbers if": null, "y'all two are off?": null, "Tula: I think, ugh, okay.": null, "Jaysohn: It's okay, Grandma's with me! I'm safe!": null, "Tula: No, no, we're not splitting up. Let's just all follow Jaysohn to": null, "the food hole. Thorn do you feel, you've seen a lot of the world.": null, "Thorn: This is fine. Jaysohn, let's just make sure we ask before we eat.": null, "Ask before we eat, Jaysohn. Otherwise, all good.": null, "Aabria: And the one last thing I'm gonna offer, because you did crit on": null, "your initial soft eyes, is that as you're moving and as you all started": null, "getting louder and louder, whatever sort of low rumble of just the world": null, "being full of sounds, is just getting a little bit quieter around you.": null, "Brennan: Okay, so as we go to follow Jaysohn to this food hole on": null, "Thorn's say so, and grandma's say so. I'm gonna just sidle up next to": null, "Viola and just look and be like,": null, "Tula:\u00a0it's so good that we've got everybody else in the family making": null, "the calls. We almost walked up and introduced ourselves.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0(laughing) And I'm going to--": null, "Ava: Jaysohn, show me that little karate routine you do for grandma, as": null, "we go. (Demonstrative combat grunts)": null, "Erika: Just floating in the air, just ah, ah!": null, "Tula: Yes, following the instincts of a child and Grandma has mentioned": null, "war already. So, that's great.": null, "Jaysohn: Just kicking off of rocks as I go.": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn you go to do a sick leap off of a rock and you catch the": null, "first sign of it. Because again, you are a little, like, you moving at": null, "your full speed versus everyone else. You're just getting a little more": null, "distance. So you can, as you normally do, start jumping off of stuff": null, "just so they can keep apace with you.": null, "Siobhan: [Siobhan] Great.": null, "Aabria: You get a little extra vision. You catch the top of something": null, "you've never seen before.": null, "Jaysohn: Ah!": null, "Aabria: And it's flat with an edge, but seems to have something like": null, "vines, though they're gray, kind of moving down it. And as you round the": null, "corner, now focused on trying to see what it is, you come across a": null, "massive, and you don't have the words for this, but a chain link fence.": null, "It is over a bunch of flat, gray ground that's no longer mossy and grass": null, "covered. And it is full of hundreds, upon hundreds of rabbits.": null, "Siobhan: They're alive?": null, "Aabria: Alive. You're the first to see it, so go ahead, and give me an": null, "investigation check. Or perception. Let's make it perception.": null, "Siobhan: Oh, thank god.": null, "Siobhan: Uh, that's a 17.": null, "Aabria: So you see it and you're like, I could fit through any one of": null, "those little holes in whatever this is. And then you see, like at the": null, "very bottom where this fence meets this concrete slab. There's a little": null, "bit of a hole pushed in where the chain link fence is pushed into the": null, "grate. And I think you're even able to figure it out. Because you've": null, "gotten into so many like, stupid scrapes that you're like, easy to go": null, "in, very hard to get out.": null, "Siobhan: Oh, okay, good.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Grandma, there's so much food, but I don't know how we get it.": null, "Ava: Oh, ho, ho, ho!": null, "Jaysohn: I've never seen so many rabbits.": null, "Ava: You should eat. You're too skinny, Jaysohn.": null, "Jaysohn: I'm so hungry.": null, "Ava:\u00a0You should eat as much as you can.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay.": null, "Aabria: Coming around the corner you all see this too and you realize": null, "that was sort of the end of the sound.": null, "Erika: Oh.": null, "Aabria: That this massive pen of hundreds of rabbits got quiet as they": null, "heard predators approaching.": null, "Brennan: I'm looking at this.": null, "Jaysohn: Mom, please. Please, can I eat a rabbit, please?": null, "Tula: We should leave.": null, "Ava: But there's so many rabbits here. Why would we leave?": null, "Lila: What's wrong, Mom?": null, "Jaysohn: [Siobhan] Why would we leave?": null, "Tula: This is... There's too much food.": null, "Ava: Too much food? Too much food.": null, "Tula: It's not right. Something's... Don't you...": null, "Jaysohn: Mom, not everything is bad. You're just always like,": null, "everything's bad all the time and sometimes there's just lots of": null, "rabbits.": null, "Lila: Shut up, Jaysohn.": null, "Jaysohn: You shut up.": null, "Lila: Don't say that to Mom.": null, "Tula: Don't say shut up. Don't say shut up.": null, "Thorn: How about this? If there's other stoats here, that perhaps have": null, "gathered this food.": null, "Lila: Yeah, let's just go in and ask them if we could have some rabbits.": null, "Thorn: Exactly, if we go in and ask them. How about this? We could say,": null, "have one of these rabbits now, but let's say we annoy the stoats that": null, "are here. Then we don't get any of the other rabbits. Whereas if we go": null, "and ask them, then we get like as many of these rabbits as we want. And": null, "you get to have rabbit every single day.": null, "Jaysohn: I annoy people all the time and I still get what I want. A lot": null, "of the time.": null, "Lila: What if every single one of these rabbits is a ribbon tongue": null, "rabbit like the chipmunks inside of the bear?": null, "Thorn: I don't know what to do with that, I'll be honest. That's a \"you\"": null, "conversation, honestly.": null, "Aabria: Lila, investigation check.": null, "Aabria: You clock, as you sort of perceive this whole fence, that": null, "there's a little square cut panel. And you see more writing on the": null, "outside of the fence.": null, "Izzy: What does it say? Can I read still?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] You have to get pretty close to it.": null, "Izzy: Okay.": null, "Aabria: Because again, it's not like a big, human sized sign. You don't": null, "know what a human is, but, something small at a stoat's eye level.": null, "Aabria: You rock up and you see, \u201cremember, only catch the rabbits that": null, "see you coming.\u201d": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Oo!": null, "Lila: It...it...": null, "Brennan: Phew. Brennan just. Tula didn't. Okay, god. That's fucked up,": null, "okay. Pow.": null, "Erika: Ha, ha, ha!": null, "Brennan: Only catch the rabbits that see you coming, my take on that is": null, "they are breeding the most alert rabbits out of the population and": null, "leaving the ones that are the most docile and don't see threats coming.": null, "Aabria: Little bit of that. Little bit of maybe something else.": null, "Ava: All right, well, I need my grandkids bellies to be full. So we can": null, "do this one of two ways. Is either we do it the way you two are good at,": null, "and we talk to these stoats. Or I just go in there and I catch 'em.": null, "Lila: The former.": null, "Ava: What?": null, "Ava: All right.": null, "Tula: And I vote with my daughter. So that's four, and that's majority.": null, "Olliver, Teedles, would you like to vote?": null, "Olliver: Wait, you're actually...": null, "Thorn: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Okay, Olliver kind of comes up. Doesn't even stand at Tula's": null, "full height. Just,": null, "Olliver:\u00a0um, I, well...": null, "Thorn: With your chest Olliver. With your chest.": null, "Olliver: This looks like a sign for people putting rabbits into the pen.": null, "Someone's always gotta be hunting. If there is as many stoats here as we": null, "think there might be, this is maybe food for a couple days. So, there's": null, "gotta be people that live in here out here. And I'm worried if we crawl": null, "in and eat a rabbit, they will treat us as poachers and deal with us": null, "accordingly.": null, "Thorn: In the same way that we would if a random animal came and": null, "attacked any of our stock.": null, "Tula: There's only one way to do this, and it's the way where Thorn and": null, "Viola talk to these people. And we're gonna be very humble, and we're": null, "gonna be very quiet, and hopefully we'll be given some food.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, Mom.": null, "Tula: Thank you, sweetie. We're gonna get you some rabbit soon.": null, "Olliver: Teedles and I can go see if, because they have to have a": null, "patrol, right?": null, "Thorn: I don't feel particularly comfortable with you branching off. I": null, "feel like we should all be together.": null, "Olliver: The last time we got split up, you got eaten by a bear.": null, "Thorn: Yes, completely correct. But had you been there, we'd all be": null, "together, and I'd know.": null, "Lila: Nobody was eaten by the bear. It was actually, we sort of went": null, "into the bear.": null, "Jaysohn: I ate some of the bear.": null, "Lila: Yeah.": null, "Tula: I understand that we were part of two different communities a few": null, "days ago. Here in this new place, with how many stoats live here, we": null, "will be seen as one unit. So we might as well think of ourselves that": null, "way.": null, "Olliver: Fair point.": null, "Tula: The best thing for us to do is to just go announce our presence,": null, "be humble. Whatever way these stoats here live, they don't live in": null, "danger of starvation. So they will only see us as a threat if we do": null, "something to attack their home.": null, "Ava: All right, let's go do it the diplomatic way, I suppose.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I start trudging.": null, "Aabria: So my question is, are you looking for a way in, or are you": null, "looking for any stoats on the outside?": null, "Rashawn: Hm... Stoats on the outside. Because I think if we're breaking": null, "and entering.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, yeah. (chuckles)": null, "Rashawn: As fun as it is, probably not the safest thing to do.": null, "Jasper: Yeah.": null, "Rashawn: So if they see us coming, they can assess us before telling": null, "everybody back inside.": null, "Brennan: I think I look at you and I'm like,": null, "Tula:\u00a0they have to have seen us coming. They're waiting to see what we": null, "do.": null, "Viola: And we haven't done anything terrible.": null, "Tula: No, which is why I don't think they're announcing themselves, but": null, "they've seen us.": null, "Erika: I pull Thorn aside for a moment.": null, "Ava:\u00a0Thorn, I know that you used to collaborate with other kinds of": null, "animals and other groups frequently. Did you ever make use of the other": null, "kinds of animals that you had?": null, "Thorn: Yes, all the time. Other animals had excellent tracking": null, "abilities, potentially even better than ours. And, ha, well, we had this": null, "one badger. He was particularly grumpy. Made an excellent patrol because": null, "nothing would go near that guy. He was huge.": null, "Ava: Interesting, and you were able to also, like when you saw the": null, "pigeon and you fucked it up in the head and you managed to get eyes on": null, "this.": null, "Ava: And others in your group could do this?": null, "Thorn: Um... It seems to be a particular skill that I have, but I'm": null, "hopeful that one day I could show other people.": null, "Ava: You could teach it to your children.": null, "Thorn: Yes.": null, "Ava: And perhaps my other grandchildren and... Everyone else.": null, "Thorn: That would make me very happy, yes.": null, "Ava: That would also make me happy.": null, "Aabria: All right, I need two tags. I want two people leading different": null, "ways to look for a stoat. So who are sort of big seekers in the squad?": null, "Rashawn: Seeking would fall under what...": null, "Aabria: I want you to tell me what stat you're gonna use. So pick two": null, "people that are sort of the ring leaders of this.": null, "Siobhan: I have an eight to survival.": null, "Aabria: Okay, Jaysohn's looking. Who else is gonna be like-": null, "Izzy: I have a nine to investigation.": null, "Aabria: Sure, all right. Let the children lead. Being supported by the": null, "adults, both of you are going to make your rolls with advantage.": null, "Rashawn: I just have my hands on your shoulder. \u201cThese are my nieces and": null, "nephews. They're so smart.\u201d": null, "Aabria: Just talking into the woods.": null, "Siobhan: Like he's wearing church shoes for the very first time. He's": null, "just so uncomfortable being like. Trying to put his best face forward.": null, "Rashawn: Please don't get dirty. Please, please, please.": null, "Izzy: [Izzy] Hi, we're not hungry.": null, "Brennan: Right before the roll happens I'm like, come here.": null, "Brennan licks his thumb and begins to mimic cleaning something off": null, "Siobhan\u2019s face.": null, "Viola: When we get in there, don't act like I don't feed you.": null, "Aabria: Let me be very clear.": null, "Rashawn: Don't ask for anything when we get in the store.": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn is somehow dirty but because he was in an egg relatively": null, "recently, he's so fucking glossy.": null, "Izzy: Egg?": null, "Brennan: Remember the egg that fell and crashed everywhere.": null, "Izzy: I was like, we're reptiles? (laughing)": null, "Aabria: Could be-": null, "Izzy: [Izzy] I would like to be. (gasping)": null, "Siobhan: I crit.": null, "Jasper: Would it be possible to add unto this? Like, do a performance": null, "check to basically be like, whatever unthreatening behavior...": null, "Siobhan: Oh yes.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Do you know what I mean?": null, "Jasper: Whether It be, because you can always tell like if something's": null, "hunting, if it's like low to the ground and sort of sniffing or": null, "whatever. But like, just kind of be like, up, upright, very kind of": null, "like, as close to this as a stoat can do. Do you know what I mean?": null, "Jasper: Just like, we're moving through this space. We're not trying to,": null, "you know, yeah.": null, "Aabria: I like that because it's a survival check, so you're looking and": null, "because you're giving chill vibes it's looking around and not hunting.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, that's what I want to, yeah.": null, "Brennan: And I think I'll grab my kids too and say,": null, "Tula:\u00a0we're not gonna talk about the Blue. We're not gonna talk about": null, "the smoke. We're not gonna talk about the bear. All that happened is": null, "there was a disease in the warren and we are looking for a new place to": null, "move and we want to help hunt here, that's it.": null, "Jaysohn: Disease in the warren? Then they're not gonna want us, because": null, "we're sick. We're not sick.": null, "Tula: Well. That's a great point.": null, "Thorn: Really good point. Jaysohn, that's fantastic.": null, "Tula: Actually, we can talk about the toxic smoke. We can't talk about": null, "anything else.": null, "Aabria: Ha, ha! Jaysohn, you feel a little ding of like, is this what": null, "respect feels like?": null, "Siobhan: I don't like it. I've gotta break something. (laughing)": null, "Aabria: You just poop a little bit to reassert your dominance.": null, "Rashawn: Sweep it away, sweep it away.": null, "Brennan: Good point, fair point, toxic smoke. We're going with smoke.": null, "Erika: So you groomed, Jaysohn, yes? All right, well I take aside Lila": null, "and I'm like, hold still. And my sand paper tongue. My mouth is just so": null, "powdery.": null, "Lila: You're making me look worse! No!": null, "Erika: As I'm licking, you know, and you're squirming, I say, listen,": null, "Ava:\u00a0you may not always agree with how Grandma acts and the way that I": null, "speak to your mother, but it got us through quite a few winters, all": null, "right? So you're gonna show me some respect and you're gonna show her": null, "some respect. And if you tell your brother to shut up, then you're cut": null, "out of the will. (gasping)": null, "Aabria: Give me an intimidation check with advantage. (chuckling)": null, "Izzy: I don't know when I haven't shown my mom respect.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] And I look at this like, Wow, I could do that.": null, "Erika: All right, yeah, that's a 19 plus seven, 26.": null, "Aabria: Yo, it's not an opposed roll. I think there's something in this": null, "moment where like, your grandma is kind of always on one. And there's": null, "something to this energy. While it's still staying sort of pleasantly": null, "menacing, there's something in the fervor of her grooming you there's": null, "something in the fervor of her grooming you that's at the very edge of": null, "painful, that's like, get your shit together. You have a sense of like--": null, "Lila: What did I do wrong?": null, "Aabria: You have a sense that your grandmother is tense. And this is a": null, "person that's such a badass, you never see her worried. So the": null, "intimidation is not her being incredibly mean to you.": null, "Izzy: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: You just realize that she's keyed the fuck up right now.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Aabria: So that's just a little extra insight for you. How did you do on": null, "your investigation?": null, "Izzy: 18.": null, "Aabria: Nice. I think you see that there are so many of these like, I'm": null, "coming back to you, because you crit. There's so many of these paths": null, "everywhere that you're like, got it. I could walk back around to the": null, "front. I see this up and over. You know that if you were given 10": null, "minutes to scurry around, you will find one of these secret holes. And": null, "they are well hidden, but now that you're sort of told about the way": null, "these paths are getting worn into the world, you're like, oh, I could": null, "find a way in. There was no way in in the front. But you could get there": null, "and you could find it if you just had a little extra time. And while": null, "you're kind of coming to that discovery, with a natural 20, you get to": null, "the sort of edge of the wood where everything around this outcropping": null, "and this pen and this massive structure is deforested. So you get close": null, "to the beginning treeline of sort of the weaker, smaller, sadder trees": null, "and you can kind of see off in the distance a massive elk. And then you": null, "look down and around it and it's almost as if like a wave of water is": null, "chasing it, but it is furry and brown and this thing is being harried by": null, "you wanna say 50 stoats.": null, "Jasper: Oh my god.": null, "Jaysohn: I... I think I found my people.": null, "Aabria: You see them and you see how fast this moose is running. And": null, "there's something in the back of your mind that like, I could keep up.": null, "Jaysohn: (under breath) I can keep up. I...": null, "Ava: Show them what you got, Jaysohn!": null, "Thorn: That's not a bad idea.": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn takes off into the woods.": null, "Tula: (weakly) Jaysohn, no. (laughing)": null, "Ava: Yes! Jaysohn, yes!": null, "Lila: Bye, Jaysohn.": null, "Tula: [Brennan] Jaysohn, no, don't do it.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] What is Jaysohn's speed?": null, "Siobhan: 40.": null, "Jasper: Okay, cool. I'm only five feet slower, so I'll keep up as much": null, "as I can with Jaysohn. I'm obviously still dropping behind a little bit,": null, "but I'll try and keep up a little bit with Jaysohn. And I'm just gonna": null, "be kind of like, okay, Jaysohn, remember we're with them, not against": null, "them. Let's go, we've got this.": null, "Viola: Come back. Just, come back.": null, "Brennan: Like fuckin', the Independence Day saucer coming in and then": null, "your son is like peddling a little or hang gliding up into it.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] A little tricycle.": null, "Brennan: You're like, no, it's not fun. It's crazy. Please stop.": null, "Izzy: Lila touches her mom and is like, he was fun sometimes. (laughing)": null, "Rashawn: Everybody pour a little out for Jaysohn right now.": null, "Jasper: Just to be very clear. I'm trying to keep as close to Jaysohn as": null, "I can, but I'm very much being like, this is Jaysohn's moment. I'm gonna": null, "be here in case something really bad happens.": null, "Erika: Yeah, I'm also following along. I'm also following along.": null, "Jasper: I'm gonna have Thorn Whip ready to just yank him outta there.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So our boys and Grandma--": null, "Brennan: Actually, as Jaysohn runs off I think I do look to Lila and I'm": null, "going to be like, uh\u2026": null, "Tula:\u00a0Keep up with your brother, don't let him die!": null, "Lila: You want me to go?": null, "Tula: Take care of him.": null, "Lila: Bye.": null, "Brennan: And then me and my- (stammers) Me and my sister are like the": null, "slowest.": null, "Aabria: (singing) Sisters, Sisters~": null, "Rashawn: So, should I be doing stretches and stuff? To really kind of": null, "prepare the body. (cast laughing) I just feel like I, from the roota to": null, "the toota is what I think would happen. And that's what I'm thinking": null, "about constantly. Like, I just feel like we're at the amusement park and": null, "we've got the coolers and we're just drinking and watching everybody run": null, "around. They'll come back when they need sunscreen.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, exactly. It's just very, I feel... It's like,": null, "Tula:\u00a0Geoffrey was always the one who would run after them and I would": null, "always have the stuff. I don't have the... I can't tell if my legs are": null, "going, or it's just my heart's not in it. I don't know.": null, "Aabria: All right, so my stoats running towards this. The closer you get": null, "the more you see, have a better sense of what's happening. This elk has": null, "its massive antlers and then you look down from its great neck and you": null, "see smaller, protrusions of more antlers coming out of its neck.": null, "Jasper: Oo!": null, "Aabria: And down its shoulders. And even into the hooves that are": null, "kicking up this dirt that you see, the stoats are trying to jump around.": null, "It's got like cloven hooves. It's just, it's spiny is the best way to": null, "describe it. This thing is terrifying. And as you look down at its feet,": null, "as it's running its full speed, and there are stoats falling back and": null, "surging forward. And occasionally one or two of them gets kicked and": null, "knocked away. Every now and then you see one get hit and doesn't get up": null, "again. But the ones are still surging around it. You see that there's": null, "something. Maybe one in every five of them has this massive metal": null, "canister on its back.": null, "Jasper: Yo.": null, "Aabria: And when they get close enough, you see them grabbing, turning": null, "it around, pulling something out, and pushing it into the ankle of the": null, "elk. And you see a little spark of bluish-purple light. Like a bit of": null, "lightning as they move it and they are directing it in a direction.": null, "Thorn: That's my thing.": null, "Izzy: I feel like we skid and stop. And just like, watch.": null, "Siobhan: Just like, eyes so wide, full dish plate eyes. Just staring at": null, "this, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.": null, "Aabria: Are you doing anything to try and avoid being seen?": null, "Siobhan: No.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Or are you just running up and going, wha!": null, "Izzy: I think we're all just like.": null, "Erika: I would like to see, you know, about the formations and about the": null, "way that they're moving as a tactical fighter. I'd like to see how": null, "they're managing the group.": null, "Aabria: I want to make yours an insight check if that feels good for": null, "you.": null, "Erika: Yes, that seems good. Um.. Yeah, all right. It's a nine. I'm": null, "going to add a Tactical Assessment to it.": null, "Aabria: Oh, what is that?": null, "Erika: So that is a battle master maneuver where I can add my": null, "superiority die to it.": null, "Aabria: A maneuver!": null, "Erika: I invented a maneuver.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] I've had a thought.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] I've found a maneuver.": null, "Erika: Ah, well...": null, "Aabria: It's okay. The thing that they're doing is not like trying to": null, "outflank another army. Like, you understand this. You have hunted bigger": null, "game and you understand it immediately. There is a mixture. They are": null, "trying to whittle this thing down knowing full well that wherever it": null, "drops they'll have to... Like, they're not trying to kill it, but": null, "they're trying to weaken it and push it in a direction. And you see that": null, "despite the 2% loss, they're getting knocked, they're getting hit, some": null, "of them aren't getting back up. They look like, we're doing it.": null, "Erika: Right.": null, "Aabria: This is working, We've done this before. And I think even with": null, "an 11, I know it's not that high, but I think you have a strong sense of": null, "like, the one that is directing, that is very fast and getting up": null, "towards the front, and you see it kind of making a choice and everything": null, "is moving in a lead stoat's direction.": null, "Erika: And they seem to be directing others, or just, at all verbally?": null, "Do I hear any?": null, "Aabria: You can hear him yelling. And there's a strong sense of like,": null, "everyone knows where we're headed and it's just sort of being reminded": null, "as you're running, like, yup, to the left. We're almost there. It's": null, "encouragement. It's, don't hit it that much in the right leg. Like, it": null, "is, okay, we're getting there. We're almost there, keep going. And it's": null, "directing. You can kind of see this like path being led back past and": null, "around where the pen is. There's something else on the very back side of": null, "this building that they're aiming for.": null, "Erika: I'd like to get in there and follow the directions of the leader.": null, "Aabria: Okay.": null, "Erika: And see how I can contribute.": null, "Aabria: Your grandmother leaves and surges into this like, ocean of": null, "stoats.": null, "Jasper: Brighter than the sun, swifter than the wind. Guidance.": null, "Viola: (weakly) Stop, no.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, can I...": null, "Jasper: I'll stay with the kids, good luck!": null, "Siobhan: I think I'm gonna run back to my mom and aunt and say,": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0there's some stoats that fell down, and like, you're so good at": null, "making them better. Can you come?": null, "Viola: Yeah.": null, "Jaysohn: You're so good at that.": null, "Rashawn: I just pull out band-aids. (laughing)": null, "Erika: [Erika] The Mom Bag!": null, "Brennan: Spit in my hands and pull out some stuff.": null, "Aabria: That zinc oxide and some little band-aids.": null, "Brennan: [Brennan] A Capri Sun.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Full of aloe vera.": null, "Erika: Yeah, yeah, orange slices.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Yeah, full soccer mom.": null, "Aabria: Lila, in this moment what are you doing? Are you running back": null, "with Jaysohn? You've watched your grandmother leave. Thorn is still here": null, "with you. Before we get back to this knot, where are you at right now?": null, "Izzy: Uh, I'm gonna go back.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Ha, ha, okay.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, and just like, Grandma's gone.": null, "Aabria: So I think you see that sense, and you're putting together the": null, "trajectory in your head. And like, yeah, what is math to a stoat? But": null, "you have that sense of like, well, as long as I don't suddenly juke in a": null, "direction for no reason I can probably lead everyone back to where it's": null, "headed.": null, "Brennan: I think when you come back and say that to me, and Thorn, are": null, "you with Lila?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yeah, what are you gonna do?": null, "Jasper: No, I think I'm gonna stay up here, because I want to support": null, "this as much as I can and I'm trying to make sure that Ava doesn't get": null, "kicked in the head by this moose. So like, I think what I'm probably": null, "doing is trying to scan around seeing if I see any potential hazards": null, "coming up, so that I can warn them. Because obviously, they're in the": null, "moment. Their main focus is on this thing. I wanna make sure that": null, "there's nothing that could spook it in a wrong direction, or being a": null, "hazard for them that they're not aware of.": null, "Aabria: Awesome. Give me a perception check. (Jasper sighing) You sort": null, "of fall into the line with this group at the back, at the fringes. And": null, "then you fan out a little wider to get a view of the direction they're": null, "running in.": null, "Jasper: Are we still technically in the woods or no?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yes, this is all woods.": null, "Jasper: Okay, hoo-hoo! Oo!": null, "Erika: Yay, there he goes!": null, "Jasper: 25. Woo!": null, "Aabria: It's like you're finally a Ranger.": null, "Jasper: Finally. Wait, I know what I'm doing.": null, "Siobhan: Ah, stupid.": null, "Aabria: And you understand. You're watching people who are comfortable": null, "with the woods and comfortable with a process doing what they do best.": null, "And then you spot something. You see a little shelf of shale that": null, "they're running over and you go like, that doesn't... Something about": null, "that doesn't look quite right. And as you peel away from the back of": null, "this group it looks like there was rain that moved through here a couple": null, "days ago and something has shifted. And if that animal runs directly": null, "over it, it might buckle and snap its leg and be immobile. And you've": null, "got about 10 seconds.": null, "Jasper: How far away is it from me?": null, "Aabria: I would say it's probably, I said 10 seconds, so let's say 120": null, "feet.": null, "Jasper: Okay, and they're not there yet, right?": null, "Aabria: They're not there yet.": null, "Jasper: Okay, I run forwards and as I'm running forward I'm gonna use my": null, "action to dash. And then Thorn sees Ava there in this moment. These": null, "vines start growing down the sides of his arms and as you see on the": null, "vines there's these little blue sprouts starting to appear. And he sort": null, "of looks down and clenches his fists. There's a little bit of crackle of": null, "energy and Thorn gets hit by lightning. And then reappears, like another": null, "fork of lightning hits the ground 30 feet away from the shale. And I'm": null, "gonna sort of be in front and do like the full airplane thing of just": null, "like, this way, this way.": null, "Aabria: Amazing! You've gotta give me a perception check with advantage.": null, "Erika: Oh my god!": null, "Rashawn: Let's do it. See, I told you he was great.": null, "Jasper: What check was this, sorry?": null, "Izzy: [Izzy] Perception.": null, "Jasper: Perception?": null, "Aabria: No, this was persuasion.": null, "Jasper: Persuasion, okay.": null, "Jasper: Nat 20! (cheering)\u00a0[Jasper] Yes!": null, "Erika: That was so satisfying!": null, "Brennan: [Brennan] You just need a crowd, baby.": null, "Aabria: Oh my god, it's literally a cult leader that's like, I need 30": null, "people or I am lost.": null, "Jasper: The second I wasn't in front of people, everything has been bad.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] That's fucking hilarious.": null, "Rashawn: You Tinkerbell'd, yay!": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] So, I'm gonna describe what happens to you.": null, "Izzy: I honestly feel like I could cry.": null, "Jasper: I'm honestly there. I'm exactly with you. I genuinely felt": null, "emotional seeing that nat 20. Oh my god.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna describe what happens here from the perspective of": null, "what Ava sees. You are now in the middle of the flock, like this pack,": null, "this herd. You see up close the sort of dancing flow of surging close to": null, "an ankle, whipping this around, pulling out a prod, and that prod": null, "shooting off a spark of lightning and you can see the muscle and tissue": null, "in the ankle of this beast tense up. Like, you see that there's damage": null, "being done, but it's just, it's death by 1,000 cuts and it's being": null, "herded. And you have perfect eyes on the leader. You see how he flows": null, "back in and makes himself seen to everyone before coming back out and": null, "leading them in the direction that they all sort of instinctively know,": null, "but could easily get lost in while trying to avoid getting hit and": null, "getting shots in. And then you look up and you see a bolt of lightning": null, "in front of you and off to the side as suddenly Thorn appears from": null, "nowhere and starts flagging everyone in a direction. And you see eyes": null, "look up and chirping and shouts of confusion. You're not recognizable": null, "and the important thing you see here is everyone, every stoat has a band": null, "of yellow-ochre-colored fabric, a sash around their waist. And you see": null, "eyes looking up at Thorn's face and looking down at his waist and like,": null, "registering this is a stranger. And then there's a moment. There's a": null, "heartbeat where that leader comes forward and you watch almost in bullet": null, "time as he takes in Thorn, looks at what Thorn's directing away from and": null, "his ears flick back in fear and surprise and alarm and a recognition of": null, "what almost happened, and he immediately follows the sign and directs": null, "them out and away. And you all surge away from this potential pitfall.": null, "Izzy: You got a new cult, baby. (laughing)": null, "Jasper: Let's go Lukura II, baby, let's go.": null, "Siobhan: Electric boogaloo. (chuckling)": null, "Aabria: So we move from this moment of Thorn Vale making himself known": null, "to this group, while simultaneously Ava blends in seamlessly. And we're": null, "gonna drift back to the rest of our family as the kids rejoin the": null, "sisters.": null, "Brennan: I see Jaysohn returning, (stammers), eat that shock of just,": null, "you're coming back, on your own? And I just go,": null, "Tula:\u00a0is everything all right? What's going on?": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, no, the... (stammers) There's some stoats that fell down": null, "and I'm like, Mom's so good at making people feel better. And, and": null, "Auntie V.": null, "Viola: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Jaysohn: So let's like, go.": null, "Rashawn: I guess we'll go to wherever the nearest tree that one of these": null, "stoats bounced off of.": null, "Izzy: We didn't see that, right?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] No, not at all.": null, "Brennan: Can I make an insight check on...": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] On whomst?": null, "Brennan: On the stoats that are on the ground.": null, "Aabria: Oh. Do you want it to be insight or medicine?": null, "Rashawn: I want to make a medicine check on them.": null, "Brennan: I...": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] What are you trying to discover?": null, "Brennan: Well...": null, "Aabria: I also trust that you picked the right stat, but I wanna be a": null, "little creepy.": null, "Brennan: Oh to be clear, as we're running over I am very reticent. And I": null, "don't think Tula acts quickly and thoughtlessly most of the time. And my": null, "son has a big heart and saw some stoats get kicked by a monster and fall": null, "down, and I'm about to go maybe save their lives. And as we run up, I": null, "wanna make sure that these don't look like people who will take my": null, "healing, get up, and hurt my children.": null, "Aabria: Vibes, okay. Go ahead and give me an insight check then.": null, "Izzy: Jaysohn's like, I've been kicked in the head a bunch and it sucks.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, and that animal is big.": null, "Brennan: A dirty 20.": null, "Aabria: Dirty 20. You see sort of three stoats still in the area that": null, "they were moving through. One posted up under a tree. One that's on the": null, "ground not really moving and then one that's like groaning and pushing": null, "themselves back up to standing that makes eye contact with you. And you": null, "see like a snarl on their face and they keep looking back in the": null, "direction that that elk moved. But then when they make eye contact with": null, "you, it's very obvious with a dirty 20 that snarl is not for you. It is": null, "for pain.": null, "Brennan: Mm-hm.": null, "Aabria: And you can see the difference in between it. Like, they just": null, "kind of see you. And there's a little bit of like, what is thi- what is?": null, "And someone slowly putting together what's happening in this moment.": null, "Rashawn: These are stoats that possibly we could communicate with? So": null, "I'd like to chitter at them or something to be like, are you good?": null, "Aabria: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Rashawn: Can I approach you? Like, try to... Let's problem solve.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yeah, what do you say?": null, "Rashawn: I say,": null, "Viola:\u00a0hello. I can see that you are hurt.": null, "Stoat: Hi.": null, "Viola: I am Viola. (coughing)": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Spits like a big old gob of blood.": null, "Viola: Oh, gosh.": null, "Aabria: And then I do it, I was like, don't do it.": null, "Viola: What can I call you?": null, "Stoat: What? Ugh. Fenneck.": null, "Viola: Fenneck?": null, "Fenneck: Yes. Hi. What is... Why are you speaking so slowly? What's": null, "wrong? Are you okay? Do you need something?": null, "Viola: I am fine.": null, "Fenneck: Are you hurt?": null, "Viola: No, I'm not hurt. Are you hurt? Can you deal with this pain? Or I": null, "could...": null, "Fenneck: I got kicked by a moose.": null, "Viola: I've never seen a moose before. So, okay, great. So I inch": null, "closer. I'm gonna touch you. I'm gonna put my hands on you. And give you": null, "a little relief, if that's all right with you.": null, "Arabia (as Fenneck) acts flirty.": null, "Viola:\u00a0I'm a married woman! (laughing)": null, "Fenneck: I don't know you and you've come to me.": null, "Lila: She's a nurse.": null, "Fenneck: You're like, I'm gonna touch you. A what?": null, "Fenneck: What is a nurse?": null, "Lila: She helps... You should let her do it.": null, "Fenneck: I also don't know who you are. Why is there a child here?": null, "Viola: This is my niece. This is Miss Lila.": null, "Jaysohn: [Siobhan] I'm Jaysohn.": null, "Fenneck: Lila. Jaysohn.": null, "Jaysohn: I saw you got kicked, it was really cool.": null, "Fenneck: Um...": null, "Viola: You can really take a hit, as we've seen.": null, "Fenneck: If you have the ability to help, please help them.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you see that they sort of point at the two stoats, neither": null, "of which are moving right now.": null, "Rashawn: Mm, okay. Then I would like to cast Aid on them. There are two,": null, "how many creatures? Two or three?": null, "Aabria: So yeah, there's three stoats. One that's talking to you.": null, "Fenneck is talking to you. One is under a tree and the other is on the": null, "ground. Neither are moving. Probably go ahead and make a medicine check": null, "real quick as you are assessing the other two.": null, "Rashawn: Because they could be rugs.": null, "Brennan: I'll give the help action.": null, "Aabria: Perfect. Do that with advantage, please.": null, "Rashawn: All right, 16.": null, "Aabria: 16. There are only two stoats here you can help. The one that is": null, "under the tree that Jaysohn specifically saw, well, and Lila saw hit the": null, "tree, is dead.": null, "Rashawn: Mm. I guess I pass over the one that is dead and give it a": null, "moment of, \u201cyou fought a good fight, I guess\u201d. And then go over to the": null, "one that still has potential and okay.": null, "Jasper: (under breath) Potential.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] I know what you meant.": null, "Brennan: Hey, you know, of the many things that are true of someone who": null, "is dead, a loss of potential is way up there.": null, "Rashawn: And then I will cast Aid on them which their hit point maximum": null, "and current hit points are increased by five.": null, "Aabria: Oh. Okay.": null, "Rashawn: So, they got a bit of sauce.": null, "Aabria: That's great, yeah. This other one that was resting on the": null, "ground you see is younger, looks to be maybe a month or two older than": null, "Jaysohn and Lila. Just sort of freshly fully adult. And this sort of": null, "very soft, labored breathing. You see something in that labored": null, "breathing and then you see something snap and the body gets a little bit": null, "fuller. As a couple ribs that were broken and a lung that as collapsed": null, "come back up.": null, "Rashawn: I'll take some of the moss off of my non-gloves.": null, "Aabria: They're not gloves. What could a glove even be? Could you": null, "imagine?": null, "Rashawn: I kind of, I spit on it and mash it together so it's a little": null, "bit of like a salve or like a stopper just to kind of press that into": null, "the wound and let it heal around itself. (coughing)": null, "Stoat: Hi, uh, hello.": null, "Viola: Hi, welcome back. I'm Viola.": null, "Stoat: (whisper) Morbid.": null, "Viola: This is my niece, Lila. Karate Jaysohn. My older sister. Hi.": null, "Sybil: Hi, Sybil.": null, "Viola: [Rashawn] Sybil, Sybil.": null, "Sybil: [Aabria] Thank you.": null, "Viola: Sybil, I know this might be a lot right now, but your friend over": null, "there, what was their name? I speak in the past tense--": null, "Sybil: What?": null, "Viola: [Rashawn] Yes.": null, "Sybil: Oh. Oh.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And Sybil sort of pushes herself up to standing and signals over": null, "to Fenneck. Like, scurries over to them and they very quickly undo the": null, "sash and fold it up. And Sybil tucks it into her sash. And just says,": null, "Sybil:\u00a0don't worry about it. Thank you. It's nice to meet, you must be": null, "new.": null, "Viola: Yes, um... It's taken us awhile, but um... We were in our own": null, "warren as a family and there was a terrible, thick dusty air. We lost a": null, "lot and we got out with just a few of us and we were hoping that maybe": null, "we could get some food for the children and somewhere warm?": null, "Sybil: Oh, yes, yes. Sure. Fenneck, are you okay?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And Fenneck kind of turns and,": null, "Fenneck:\u00a0yeah, I'm gonna go make sure that. I'm gonna jump back in there": null, "and let them know about\u2026": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you see them both sort of glance in the direction of the": null, "fallen stoat. But they very specifically never say a name.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Okay, I'll show them in. Thank you, thank you.": null, "Viola: Oh, and my mom's over there.": null, "Sybil: Your mom?": null, "Viola: My mother. Do you not have mothers?": null, "Sybil: No, I understand. No, sorry. Conceptually I understand what a": null, "mother... Okay, I'm sorry. I got kicked incredibly hard, I think I was": null, "dying.": null, "Viola: I'm asking so many questions right now, I'm so sorry. I'm just": null, "trying to be as accommodating as possible.": null, "Sybil: No, you're fine. And you helped, so you're doing great.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Fenneck at this point has sort of taken off a little bit slowly,": null, "kind of limping. And then is picking up speed and heading back in the": null, "direction that the spiny elk and that herd were in. And she says,": null, "Sybil:\u00a0okay, so your mom is a member of Last Bast, but you were": null, "somewhere else and you're trying to find her? What's happening?": null, "Viola: Last Bast?": null, "Sybil: Yes, this place.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you see she just points back. You're looking at essentially": null, "the backside of this massive building. You're on the far side of the": null, "rocky outcrop.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0This is Last Bast. Welcome.": null, "Rashawn: She bows.": null, "Sybil: Oh, sure.": null, "Viola: Just to give you a little bit of respect.": null, "Sybil: (mimics kissing Viola\u2019s head) I don't know what to do. I'm sorry,": null, "that was weird.": null, "Viola: Thank you.": null, "Sybil: Oh, great. That went well. That went well.": null, "Viola: Yeah, so we have about six with us.": null, "Sybil: Okay.": null, "Viola: Six or eight or so. And all signs told us to come towards you and": null, "we'd never seen so many...": null, "Sybil: That's the Light.": null, "Viola: Stoats.": null, "Sybil: Yeah.": null, "Viola: There's so many of you.": null, "Sybil: [Aabria] Thousands.": null, "Viola: Thousands?": null, "Lila: What's that?": null, "Sybil: What do you mean? What do you mean?": null, "Viola: [Rashawn] A lot is Like forty.": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, I'm so glad you asked.": null, "Lila: What's thousand?": null, "Sybil: Do you know what a hundred is?": null, "Lila: No.": null, "Sybil: Do you know what 50 is?": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah.": null, "Sybil: Okay, 50. Do that twice. That's a hundred.": null, "Jaysohn: That's so many.": null, "Sybil: And now do 100 of those.": null, "Jaysohn: No.": null, "Sybil: Okay, lost ya, totally fine. (laughing) Interesting.": null, "Jasper: Jaysohn disappears.": null, "Sybil: Yes, Miss Lila.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she's beginning to limp and trying to lead you all": null, "somewhere.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Uh, yes?": null, "Lila: Um, did you guys, um, did one of the thousands, um... Make the": null, "thing that said, about the rabbits?": null, "Sybil: Oh, the sign?": null, "Lila: Hm?": null, "Sybil: The sign about the rabbits?": null, "Jaysohn: She can understand the shadows on the scratches.": null, "Sybil: She can read? You can read? (Brennan and Rashawn sounding out the": null, "word 'Read')": null, "Lila: [Izzy] What's that? (laughing) Yes.": null, "Tula: My daughter can do anything she puts her mind to.": null, "Lila: Thank you, Mommy.": null, "Aabria: And there's something really important here. Where she was sort": null, "of regarding you all, probably Tula the least so, since she didn't": null, "really speak up very much, but all of the attention sort of snaps unto,": null, "like, oh good, someone to talk to. Like, not in a disrespectful way, but": null, "like, got it.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0Okay, yeah. Yes, the sign. Right, because there's a lot of": null, "rabbits in these woods. It's just sort of, you know, who's ever on their": null, "hunting shift, just a reminder to not bring back the infected rabbits.": null, "We don't know. We just don't want. It's a lot of stoats and--": null, "Lila: Did you guys get sick?": null, "Sybil: Yeah, like a little. It's just not good meat, you know?": null, "Sybil: But you saw the sign. Oh, incredible.": null, "Lila: Yeah. Some people at our old warren, not us, Some people at our": null, "old warren, not us, got sick and died.": null, "Sybil: Oh, I'm so sorry.": null, "Lila: Did that happen to you guys?": null, "Sybil: Um, well no. I was actually born here. But there's other stoats": null, "that have come from other places and a lot of times people just sort of": null, "come here because they feel the call of the Light and they just--": null, "Lila: The Light!": null, "Lila: You guys know about the Light?": null, "Sybil: Yeah! Do you... Yeah, everyone knows. Everyone here knows about": null, "the Light.": null, "Lila: Do you guys make the Blue?": null, "Sybil: Make the Blue?": null, "Lila: Do you make the Blue?": null, "Sybil: Oh no, no, no. Um... Hm. It's an interesting question. We don't": null, "make it, but it is from here and it--": null, "Lila: It's from here?": null, "Sybil: Yeah, you feel it, right?": null, "Sybil: So like, yeah. I was born here, again, so this is kind of just": null, "what I've heard, but lots of--": null, "Lila: So the Blue is safe?": null, "Sybil: Yeah, it brought us all together. And we live here and we're safe": null, "and...": null, "Lila: Does anything really, really bad happen here?": null, "Tula: Sweetie.": null, "Sybil: What do you mean?": null, "Tula: Sybil's just had a big accident.": null, "Lila: Sorry.": null, "Sybil: No, you're good. You don't have to apologize. Oh, I'm sorry.": null, "Please continue your very good moment. I'm not here.": null, "Lila: My grandma has candy. If you want candy.": null, "Jaysohn: [Siobhan] And it's really good.": null, "Sybil: And she's there?": null, "Jaysohn: But you have to be really nice to her otherwise she won't give": null, "it to you.": null, "Lila: She ran into your crowd and I sort of thought, maybe I'd never see": null, "her again.": null, "Sybil: Oh, well, she didn't get the shit kicked out of her. We can go": null, "catch, do you wanna go catch up?": null, "Lila: She probably didn't.": null, "Jaysohn: Oh my god, our grandma is so strong.": null, "Lila: Yeah, can we go in with you guys? That's okay? You don't kill me": null, "and my family?": null, "Sybil: You? No, you're... No, why would we hurt you?": null, "Viola: Yeah, what do you do with the elk? Once you're done with your": null, "shift, your herding?": null, "Tula: We need to get the children some food.": null, "Sybil: [Aabria] Oh, yes.": null, "Tula: Thank you so much for offering us a place to stay.": null, "Sybil: Of course, come with me.": null, "Tula: We'll do our best to be useful to the rest of the warren.": null, "Jaysohn: You're really nice and really pretty.": null, "Lila: You're really cool.": null, "Sybil: Thank you. You guys are really cool too.": null, "Lila: Yeah, my mom is really, really cool and nice. So is my auntie.": null, "Tula: It's my two children, my sister, and her husband, our mother, the": null, "children's grandmother, and two friends and long time companions of": null, "Viola's husband. So there's eight of us in total. We'd be happy to make": null, "our own space and not intrude on anyone else.": null, "Lila: And like, some really bad things have been happening to us.": null, "Jaysohn: I dropped an egg.": null, "Aabria: And we are walking and talking, yeah.": null, "Lila: Okay, so basically all of this poison came to our warren and like": null, "killed everybody and it was really, really bad and we had to run away.": null, "Jaysohn: It was scary. I ran so fast.": null, "Lila: Yeah, Jaysohn ran really fast.": null, "Jaysohn: Nobody can run as fast as me, but I was helping, I was helping.": null, "Lila: And this old lady who took care of us sometimes died. And this guy": null, "who was trying to hook up with our mom died.": null, "Jaysohn: [Siobhan] Yes.": null, "Lila: Like, everybody we know died. And then we were in the woods--": null, "Jaysohn: And we saw the badger but then it ran away.": null, "Lila: Yeah, and then we were trying to sort of like, save ourselves or": null, "whatever and find something and get away from the poison, but also try": null, "and figure out, I wanted to build a big thing so we could maybe like,": null, "kill the poison and kill all the crazy creatures that my uncle has seen.": null, "Jaysohn: But we're not supposed to tell 'em about the bear.": null, "Lila: Okay.": null, "Sybil: About the?": null, "Lila: But the bear was cool.": null, "Sybil: The bear?": null, "Jaysohn: That's what I think.": null, "Lila: Okay, we saw this crazy--": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, but you can't tell anyone.": null, "Lila: We saw this crazy wolf.": null, "Sybil: I won't tell anyone. I'm sorry could you say that one more time?": null, "Viola: You gotta put food in their mouth, or they'll just keep talking.": null, "(laughing)": null, "Viola: Just put like a rabbit leg or something in there.": null, "Sybil: I will put food-- Yeah?": null, "Lila: It was a really big, scary animal. It had a bunch of holes in it.": null, "And it was like alive, but not really. And it was sort of being": null, "controlled by all these chipmunks who were eating the heart--": null, "Jaysohn: And they had these tongues that were like. (Siobhan gurgling)": null, "Lila: They had these ribbon things that came out and ripped a bunch of": null, "them out! I ripped one of their faces off, because they tried to kill my": null, "brother and my mom!": null, "Jaysohn: Wait, wait, wait!": null, "Lila: And then my mom ate the heart.": null, "Jaysohn: You have to show her. No, you have to show her the mask. You": null, "have to show her the mask!": null, "Lila: Oh, Auntie, Auntie, Auntie, Auntie! Give me my mask back!": null, "Rashawn pulls the top of her shirt up slightly and pretends to pull out": null, "something, then pretends to toss it to Izzy.": null, "Aabria: Okay, let me be very clear that the thing that just happened": null, "here, you're not wearing clothes. You just opened up a fold of your fur": null, "and pulled an animal's face out?": null, "Rashawn: Well, I don't have a bag.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. And that was the most hard shit Sybil's ever seen. And": null, "just went.": null, "Sybil:\u00a0And think there's some-- That's what that is, yes.": null, "Lila: But we lived! And then um, um, my brother and my mom and uh, uh,": null, "and... I think, I don't know. Like, some people ate some of it, and then": null, "it was like, what? And it had the Blue in it! And it was made out of": null, "Blue. So made out of the Light. And I always thought the Blue was really": null, "bad, because like, everything, you know...": null, "Jaysohn: Because they were like 'The Blue is bad.' all of our childhood.": null, "Lila: Yeah, and like, because our dad's dead and like Grandma is--": null, "Jaysohn: Our dad is dead, we don't have a dad.": null, "Lila: Grandma's seen really scary stuff. And so it's like, yeah. And so": null, "it's like, I wanna just build a big thing. But it looks like you guys": null, "built this really big thing, this big house, this big rock. That's like": null, "hard and soft.": null, "Jaysohn: Are there other stoats our age? Are we gonna have friends?": null, "Sybil: Yeah, oh, plenty.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And I think the important thing for my adults specifically to": null, "note, other than the fact that Sybil is only a little bit older than": null, "them. So, sort of has the enthusiasm.": null, "Izzy: We met a teenager who-- who worked in the army,": null, "Siobhan: It's like a cool older cousin is here.": null, "Izzy: And her ears are pierced!": null, "Siobhan: And she's got the bands you're not supposed to be listening to.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0And we're just like, okay, so ah! (messes with her hair)": null, "Aabria: 100%. So she's got the stamina for this, which is probably a big": null, "relief. But also, there is nothing that they said.": null, "The camera pans over to Brennan, who is dissociating (as Tula,": null, "jokingly).": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah! (laughing)": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Oh my gosh.": null, "Aabria: There is nothing that those children said that looks surprising": null, "to Sybil. And all you see from her is an increasingly bigger smile that": null, "looks a little feral, especially when talking about how you guys both": null, "destroyed those chipmunks. And she's just like, yeah, good.": null, "Brennan: I'll make a little insight check just to,": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] She's a bad influence.": null, "Brennan: It's a 24. (nonchalantly)": null, "Aabria: (wheezes) God damn. You said it so casual, bud.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Is it perception?": null, "Aabria: No, insight.": null, "Rashawn: Insight. Cool, 11. A fat 11.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, your fat 11--": null, "Brennan: I think my deep, deep silence in this moment is being like, you": null, "know, it's just, (stammers) \u201cI'm a woman who's been fighting the tide to": null, "keep a sandcastle together.\u201d And I'm just like, \u201cit's out of the bag. I": null, "don't even know what a bag is. It's like, there's no stopping it. What": null, "am I gonna do, make 'em not tell the stuff they know? Is that gonna last": null, "for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30? Don't fight this fight.\u201d So I'm using": null, "their enthusiasm and the fact that I know she's not noticing me to": null, "really focus on her.": null, "Aabria: You drill into this immediately. That like, this is someone who": null, "was born here whose heard a lot about other stoats and the stories of": null, "how other stoats have gotten here is probably part of the reason why she": null, "is so nonplussed with these stories of these other animals. The true,": null, "full comfort with how violent all of this is, The true, full comfort": null, "with how violent all of this is, is deeply apparent. Like, yup, life is": null, "violent. You guys did the right thing. But there is that sense of like,": null, "there is nothing predatory in the look she's giving them other than": null, "like, yes, correct, you've done the right thing.": null, "Brennan: And we're pretty violent. I mean the Red Warren was not an": null, "unviolent place, either. Do I sense something different in the": null, "relationship to the violence than I would be used to seeing from us in": null, "the Red Warren?": null, "Brennan: [Brennan] In terms of scale?": null, "Aabria: Yes, with a 24 I think there is that, there is a difference": null, "between hunting rabbits to eat and being that close to having to kill": null, "and consume to survive, versus, they took care of threats. And the sort": null, "of complexity of the thing that you dealt with. Like, that wasn't for": null, "food, that was for safety and security and defense and protection and": null, "all of those bigger and more complex and social and civil ways in which": null, "violence is enacted that she took without a second thought. And is very": null, "like, yes, of course, good.": null, "Brennan: I think that I have just a little thought to myself that I": null, "don't even know that I would be able to articulate it. But it's": null, "basically just a thought of kindness from abundance.": null, "Aabria: Yes.": null, "Brennan: Of looking around and being like, look at how kind the people": null, "who have everything they need are. And there's just some, but it's not a": null, "pleasant thought. It's a thought of like, \u201chm, okay. Yeah, no one here": null, "is hungry so they're acting like people who aren't hungry.\u201d": null, "Aabria: She is utterly unworried about you.": null, "Brennan: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Doesn't know anything about you. Has not asked for anything and": null, "is outnumbered and deeply injured and doesn't look even a little bit": null, "concerned.": null, "Rashawn: But that worries me because people who have never been poor": null, "before, they're not scared. Like, we've been in a situation where we": null, "haven't had a lot. And we've made due by people who have too much.": null, "People who live in excess.": null, "Aabria: Right.": null, "Rashawn: I'm a little wary of that. And now I'm thinking of culture": null, "Rashawn: How are they operating differently than we would in how we grew": null, "up?": null, "Brennan: I'm just gonna give a look to my sister, just to, with zero": null, "face on it.": null, "Brennan: Just the fact that like, the eye contact speaks for itself.": null, "Aabria: You see the Sybil after kind of walking--": null, "Viola: Girl... (laughing)": null, "Tula: Must be nice.": null, "Aabria: After walking this off is going to come back. As she goes up and": null, "you guys kind of round the corner and we'll jump back to the main group": null, "in a second. But you see as she's sort of getting closer to everything,": null, "she's going to work quite hard to push herself up to standing and will": null, "walk bipedal in order to--": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Oo! Whoa.": null, "Izzy: [Izzy] Oh, on two feet?": null, "Aabria: On two feet.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Oh yeah, culture shock.": null, "Siobhan: I immediately do that too.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, I try and do it.": null, "Siobhan: She's so cool that me and Lila are--": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] I mean, sure do it.": null, "Siobhan: All the cool kids are standing upright? Okay, I could do that.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Give me an athletics or acrobatics check.": null, "Siobhan: Great.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] Gives me like, when you walk into a place...": null, "Siobhan: Oh my god.": null, "Izzy: Nat one? I got a dirty 20.": null, "Aabria: Lila, taking your time and just sort of watching. You're picking": null, "up things very quickly and you see how she pushes herself up to standing": null, "and starts walking. Especially a little injured, is a little forward so": null, "that if she has to drop back down she can. But is a little hunched.": null, "Izzy: I'm sort of walking with a limp.": null, "Aabria: It's careful. Smooth is slow, and slow is fast. The idea of": null, "working hard and doing it right makes consistent results and you figure": null, "it out.\u00a0You're like, a little flip wizard.": null, "Siobhan: I can do that, whoa.": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yeah! You over correct and land on your back.": null, "Siobhan: I'm like two kids in a trench coat. (laughing)": null, "Jaysohn: This is fully the 'I played Tony Hawk and now I can skateboard'": null, "person.": null, "Siobhan: Exactly, exactly.": null, "Aabria: 100%. And then we'll use that to cut back to Ava and Thorn with": null, "this group. Ava you're inside of like, they all charge past you. You get": null, "a nod from one person in particular that sounded the alarm, you're able": null, "to see. You've spotted the leader in this group. And they move past you": null, "and you are suddenly regarded by more stoats at one time than you've": null, "ever seen before.": null, "Jasper: Whew.": null, "Aabria: And they all are nodding, and then surging and flowing out. It's": null, "very much like the Roman legion of get in, get your shot, fall back,": null, "build up your strength, get in get your shot. So you're seeing this": null, "rushing wave, and this efficient system. And then everyone on the": null, "periphery acknowledges you and gives a little nod as you go forward. And": null, "Ava, you're surging in the middle. I have a question. Do you do anything": null, "while you're in the middle of this?": null, "Erika: Yes, I follow any orders that are being given or directed at me.": null, "Is the leader or companions around me, are they taking any notice of me,": null, "or I give them like the nod.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you're in there and you see a couple people in this crush": null, "clocked that you're not wearing a sash. But you're sort of still moving": null, "in the flow of what's happening. And you're hearing not specific orders": null, "other than the one from this leader, but barks, and you're seeing like a": null, "ripple. Like a bark means push in. A bark means flow out. So you can": null, "move through this, and if you're keeping with them, at like the third or": null, "fourth bark you will be right next to the spiny elk. So what do you want": null, "to do?": null, "Erika: Right. So I'm gonna lash out and I would like to pick a point.": null, "There are still soft spots that are unarmored, yes?": null, "Aabria: There's lots of unarmored spots. And there's lots of like,": null, "there's a zap and a zap and plenty of stoats that don't have those. And": null, "you see them targeting flesh that's becoming more and more exposed.": null, "Erika: Oh. I've seen that they use these things, so I, too, pick up and": null, "I take a strike at an open wound.": null, "Aabria: Give me an attack roll with advantage as one of the stoats next": null, "to you gives you the help action. They see you beginning to swing, and": null, "you see them like, push you into the right spot so that you're not": null, "losing any of your momentum as you go forward. Like, they surge you up": null, "to get a hit in.": null, "Erika: That's a 23!": null, "Aabria: Absolutely hits, give me damage.": null, "Erika: Wah, ha, ha.": null, "Aabria: I have a question, are you doing this as a normal hit? Or are": null, "you using any of your barbarian or fighter abilities?": null, "Erika: We'll see, hang on.": null, "Aabria: Ha, okay.": null, "Siobhan: Wow.": null, "Erika: All right, that's 11 points of damage, plus as I do it, I'm": null, "gonna... Use... The bone to sort of dig in and sort of, like, start ice": null, "picking my way up to grapple.": null, "Aabria: So you want to stay on it?": null, "Erika: Yes. Grappling strike.": null, "Aabria: Interesting.": null, "Siobhan: [Siobhan] That's cool. That's my grandma.": null, "Aabria: Okay, I need you to make a strength check.": null, "Erika: Okay, um...": null, "Aabria: If I have you make it with disadvantage, because this is not": null, "like what the other stoats are doing. So you surge forward, get a hit": null, "in, and the moment you start to cling, you feel people like trying to": null, "get you out of the way for them to go next.": null, "Erika: Okay, I can still add, this is just a strength check or": null, "athletics?": null, "Aabria: Athletics.": null, "Erika: Do I still have...": null, "Jasper: Guidance?": null, "Erika: Guidance.": null, "Jaysohn: I haven't used anything. It was right before the 10 seconds. So": null, "I don't know how long, if it's been a minute since then.": null, "Aabria: All right, we'll say that you're at the very end of your ability": null, "to use Guidance.": null, "Erika: All right.": null, "Aabria: So you're rolling with disadvantage, but with added d4.": null, "Erika: D4, okay. Whew, all right. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 17.": null, "Jasper: Oof.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Again, there's that sense of, no one is phased by you": null, "suddenly bringing out and using a tool. They're like great, big swing,": null, "good. They make space for you. You connect. And this flesh that was": null, "already sort of pink and raw, less like a cut and more like a rash of": null, "just like when you hit and skid. You land and dig in. You feel yourself": null, "connecting with some of the tendon at the bottom of this elk's hoof. And": null, "then you grab on and you stay there. And you can feel the surging press": null, "of other stoats trying to move you and get you out of the way.": null, "Aabria: But you're able to hold on. What do you do while you're there?": null, "Erika: I'm holding on. I'm gonna action surge and I'm gonna attack": null, "again. This one with claw.": null, "Erika: So I just, yeah. I'm into it, um... Ah, rats, that's an eight.": null, "Jasper: You could attack recklessly if you...": null, "Erika: Yeah, that's true.": null, "Jasper: Sorry, that was the wrong show. I apologize.": null, "Siobhan: Welcome to the... (laughing)": null, "Brennan: Iyengar, Mulligan, Thompson, and Cartwright, there ya go.": null, "Erika: Damn, that's good.": null, "Aabria: Okay, so are you recklessly attacking?": null, "Erika: [Erika] Recklessly attacking.": null, "Aabria: Sure.": null, "Erika: Yeah! There it is! Okay, 16 plus... So that's a 22.": null, "Aabria: 22 hits.": null, "Erika: 22 hits and that's gonna be 2d10.\u00a0(under breath) Okay so, (dice": null, "rattling)": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] (whisper) Fuck.": null, "Rashawn: Is she gonna take down this elk all by herself?": null, "Izzy: Is an elk and a moose the same thing?": null, "Erika: That's an 11.": null, "Aabria: Okay, for 11 more points of damage?": null, "Erika: 11 more points of damage.": null, "Aabria: Okay, you get onto this elk and even though you feel people sort": null, "of pushing past you, and eventually people trying to grab you and pull": null, "you down to keep the flow moving, you stay on and swipe again with your": null, "claws. And you are just buried in. Truly feeling like, yeah, I'm good at": null, "this. Like this is what we do and I am good at it. And look at this": null, "group collaboration on what's happening.": null, "Erika: I do this. I'm hanging on. I'm slashing. I do look to the leader": null, "though.": null, "Aabria: He looks back at you and you see him giving you a very strange": null, "look.": null, "Erika: I don't know what that means! I don't think.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, I mean, look, there's no insight check here. You've now": null, "broken formation.": null, "Erika: Ah.": null, "Aabria: And then because reckless attack works that I get advantage": null, "back. I did crit on hitting you.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Oof.": null, "Aabria: As the stoats surge forward.": null, "Erika: Okay.": null, "Aabria: I need you to make a strength saving throw.": null, "Erika: It's a...s- wait. Yeah, 17.": null, "Aabria: With a 17, you don't know if it's ripped or knocked. If this was": null, "an accident or on purpose, or just the way a well oiled machine works": null, "when you are suddenly the gear that doesn't know the timing. And you get": null, "hit and knocked down. You're going to take 17 points of bludgeoning": null, "damage.": null, "Aabria: As you are now de-synced from the group, but with a 17 you are": null, "not trampled by 50 stoats.": null, "Erika: Oof!": null, "Jasper: Let's go. Let's go.": null, "Erika: Ho, ho, that was, yeah.": null, "Aabria: You fall back in and you see now, this elk has slowed down": null, "significantly because of your wound specifically. So now you see that": null, "there's a bit of a weird pulse happening with the group as they're": null, "trying to accommodate for an uneven gait. And as you're sort of trying": null, "to adjust. Like what are you trying to do in this moment? Do you stay": null, "apart of it, or are you trying to?": null, "Erika: I realize that I messed up. You don't go against formation. I was": null, "trying to get in, make my presence known, do some damage, get out. I'm": null, "gonna try and sync back up again and I'm going to use. Oh, here we go.": null, "I'm gonna use Rally to the ones around me to be like, follow, follow": null, "him. And that's the...": null, "Izzy: This bitch is crazy.": null, "Erika: That's the man, that's the man that's married to my daughter.": null, "Rashawn: Ha, ha, ha!": null, "Brennan: Let's be clear here. A group of cowboys are moving cows. Ya,": null, "ya! Chasing them. And from behind a rock, a viking runs out and chops a": null, "cow's head off. And goes, we're doing it! And they go, no! No!": null, "Izzy: They shoot him.": null, "Brennan: And then the Viking falls down and says, way to go, team!": null, "Erika: Yup. Yeah!": null, "Izzy: Like a true psycho.": null, "Aabria: I love it. I love it. So you do that. You bolster the group.": null, "Give me a performance check.": null, "Aabria: Not only to like pass yourself off as, we're all doing it.": null, "Erika: [Erika] Yup.": null, "Aabria: But also just to hit the formation again.": null, "Erika: Got it, got it, got it.": null, "Aabria: The DC's gonna be pretty low because you are still very good at": null, "Erika: I am.": null, "Aabria: You didn't really like fuck up. It was just a little like, what": null, "are you doing? This isn't how we practiced.": null, "Brennan: I got lost in the sauce. We were chasing these cows. I shot": null, "one, I'm sorry.": null, "Aabria: Sometimes you're like, fuck that cow.": null, "Jasper: I was too locked in.": null, "Erika: So here's the thing, I have minus four to all of my charisma": null, "checks.": null, "Rashawn: [Rashawn] No! Ugh!": null, "Erika: Oh, but it is a nat 20. (cheering)": null, "Jasper: Whoo. Brrrow. Pew, pew! Pew, pew!": null, "Aabria: And I think you feel a tense moment pass. Now, your family says": null, "it all the time, but you have the thought for the first time, maybe I": null, "was a little much.": null, "Erika: All right, yeah.": null, "Aabria: But your Rally pulses through the group and you find yourself": null, "back in the rhythm again. And then you look over and you see the leader": null, "has pulled up beside you. And like, is sort of clearing people around": null, "you to make sure that you weren't getting trampled as you came down.": null, "Gives you a little nod, and then is going to move to the elk's ankle and": null, "everyone's still doing this weird pulse. Like, oh, this thing's running": null, "funky now and we have to get it there. You see him run over and he's": null, "going to press his hand against the wound. And you watch as a little bit": null, "of glow, a light generates from his hands as he's going to heal the elk.": null, "To restore it so it no longer limps. And then he sprints out and away.": null, "And if you follow you can follow in his wake back up to the front.": null, "Ava: Excuse me, young man.": null, "Stoat: Yeah?": null, "Ava: I'm sorry that I may have over stepped my bounds. I'm sorry you": null, "feel that I have somehow--": null, "Stoat: This is--": null, "Ava: Fallen out of step with the group.": null, "Stoat: Nope you're great, you're doing it.": null, "Izzy: And a 70-year-old.": null, "Stoat: You're so good. Who the fuck are you?": null, "Ava: Oh hello, I'm Ava. I've come from the Red Warren.": null, "Stoat: Watch out, watch out.": null, "Ava: Okay, oh, whoa.": null, "Stoat: Yup, okay, follow me.": null, "Ava: Okay.": null, "Aabria: And he's going to try to lead you up to the front.": null, "Stoat:\u00a0You don't have to apologize. Not now, not now.": null, "Ava: To be very clear, I wasn't apologizing!": null, "Stoat: You said, \"Sorry.\" That came out of your mouth. I heard that.": null, "Ava: I said I'm sorry you feel that I was out of step.": null, "Stoat: Yep, I heard sorry, you've apologized. You are submissive and I": null, "get that. Thank you so much.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And he moves over to the side. And you see where this elk is": null, "being led. There's a massive pit. Just concrete on four sides that drops": null, "down at a slope. And you actually see that there's a big cement": null, "rectangle high in the air. And at the bottom of this pit you see a": null, "female moose, not spiny, but there's a female moose there. And there is": null, "like large piles of, what looks like rotting fruit and grasses and": null, "leaves. And like, as the rest surges forward he's going to mom arm you,": null, "to hold you back, and you see how they all kind of scatter and peel away": null, "and let the elk run down this pit. And this leader points up and you see": null, "a couple little stoats on the top of something standing in front of a": null, "little metal rectangle. And he points, you see a stoat nod. It ducks": null, "down and the cement door slides down trapping the elk there.": null, "Erika: Whoa, uh-huh.": null, "Stoat: Is everyone okay? How many people? Sorry, can you hold for two": null, "seconds. You good? You said your son is here?": null, "Ava: No, no, my...": null, "Stoat: Did someone lose an old woman? (laughing)": null, "Brennan: To extend the metaphor. The Viking then gets up, sprints after": null, "the cowboys and goes, so what do you guys do here? (laughing)": null, "Izzy: And is 70.": null, "Siobhan: So small, so wiry.": null, "Rashawn: 'Scuse me. If I could just inquire.": null, "Brennan: After being like, \"Go team!\" Was like, \"Wait, what are we": null, "doing?\"": null, "Siobhan: Where's the good spots for brunch? I'm a little peckish.": null, "Aabria: And because of this wide turn that they made to get the elk in": null, "at the right angle, all of you sort of moving in this direction could": null, "take like the straightest line there and as everyone's sort of winding": null, "down, and these stoats are taking numbers, and half of 'em are just on": null, "their backs releasing their packs of cattle prods and just catching": null, "their breath.": null, "Erika: I follow along. I'm doing a walk-and-talk with this guy and I'm": null, "like,": null, "Ava:\u00a0well, you see my children and my grandchildren and then the two,": null, "you know, cult lead- uh... Cultured people that hangout with my": null, "son-in-law we all came here from very far away. Our warren is not really": null, "a viable place to live right now and so we're looking for another place": null, "to live, but I'm sure that, my children are very, very capable. And are": null, "you, you don't happen to have a family of your own, do you?": null, "Stoat: Me personally?": null, "Ava: No, yes, yes, yes.": null, "Stoat: Oh, uh... I have... Yeah, my family lives... Are you asking?": null, "Ava: Are you single? Are you single?": null, "Stoat: Oh, oh! Did someone lose this woman?": null, "Ava: We rock up.": null, "Thorn: Yes, sorry. I think I might have lost.": null, "Ava: Oh there he is.": null, "Stoat: You!": null, "Erika: This is Thorn. Thorn this is uh...": null, "Bennett: Bennett.": null, "Ava: [Erika] Bennett.": null, "Bennett: [Aabria] Hi. Thank you for that.": null, "Jasper: Oh, I'll, if I can, rock up with Olliver and Teedles. On the": null, "way, by the way, I was like to Olliver and Teedles. (whisper)": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Did you see that shit? Did you see that?": null, "Teedles: (whisper) That was so fucking cool. You did that thing,": null, "Thorn: There's was like a bolt of lightning and then I just appeared. It": null, "was really cool.": null, "oLila: But there was like, lightning. And you did it and then everyone,": null, "I thought they were gonna all run you over or just be like, fuck that": null, "guy. And give you the little thing, and it was great. Oh, hold on, hold": null, "on. You're being addressed, you're being addressed.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0They turn and like push you forward.": null, "Thorn: Gah, ah!": null, "Ava: This is my son-in-law and the future father of my grandchildren.": null, "Bennett: Oh, so not the single one.": null, "Ava: (quietly) No.": null, "Bennett: Okay, it's nice to meet you.": null, "Thorn: Pleasure.": null, "Bennett: [Aabria] Hi, Bennett.": null, "Jasper: Does he extend a paw?": null, "Aabria: He does.": null, "Jasper: I'm like,": null, "Thorn:\u00a0(whisper) what is that? (chuckling)": null, "Jasper slaps his hand, as though Thorn slaps Bennett\u2019s hand.": null, "Bennett: Why?": null, "Thorn: Um, was that incorrect? (laughing)": null, "Bennett: Interesting. You do it. You do this.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And he's gonna grab your arm.": null, "Thorn: Ah!": null, "Bennett: Oh, oh, we're screaming. There we go. Okay, you're a jumpy guy.": null, "Ava: Oh, I want to do this too!": null, "Aabria: Immediately like a, oh yeah.": null, "Ava: Ah!": null, "Bennett: Oh, okay. You're just impaling me on these trees.": null, "Erika: It's like a vice.": null, "Aabria: You established dominance with me in that moment. Like, ow,": null, "Erika, ow. Go ahead and just give me an athletics check.": null, "Erika: Oh, yay.": null, "Aabria: Oh shit. You have to beat a 15.": null, "Erika: Oh, that's a...twenty.. 21.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, he goes to shake your paw, and you feel a bone pop. And he": null, "goes,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0ow, okay. Oh. Oh, got it.": null, "Ava: Very nice to meet you, Bennett.": null, "Bennett: Great, great, ow, ow. Okay. You're strong, I get it.": null, "Ava: Mm-hm.": null, "Bennett: You almost maimed. Thank you.": null, "Bennett: Okay, okay, hello.": null, "Thorn: Hello.": null, "Aabria: And then he turns and looks and sees the rest of you coming up.": null, "Like, \u201coh, there's more.\u201d": null, "Viola: Hi, um.": null, "Bennett: Hi.": null, "Viola: We helped Sybil.": null, "Bennett: Yes!": null, "Viola: Get back on her feet.": null, "Bennett: Yeah, thank you. You did that? Thank you.": null, "Viola: Yes, this is my sister Tula.": null, "Bennett: Hi. Bennett?": null, "Tula: Hello.": null, "Bennett: I'm Bennett, it's so nice to meet you.": null, "Ava: That's the single one.": null, "Bennett: Right here? Okay, um.": null, "Tula: Thank you, Mom.": null, "Tula: It's very nice to meet you.": null, "Bennett: So nice to meet you.": null, "Tula: Thank for accepting us into the warren.": null, "Bennett: I'm not gonna be weird. Wait, sorry, what?": null, "Thorn: We haven't quite got to that bit yet, ha.": null, "Tula: Oh, we spoke to Sybil.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, Sybil's just next to you like.": null, "Arabia shrugs confusedly.": null, "Tula: We spoke to Sybil who mentioned that we might be able to feed our": null, "children here. Obviously, when I say accepted into the warren I mean": null, "only for so long as you...": null, "Bennett: Oh, okay you're... Ma'am, you are fine. We'll be happy to have": null, "you. We take in new stoats all the time. Yeah, it was just. I wasn't": null, "sure, because you don't have a... It's fine. Welcome.": null, "Tula: Thank you.": null, "Bennett: Welcome all of you. That's your mother.": null, "Tula: Yeah, what did she do? (laughing)": null, "Bennett: Well, we were trying to get that big elk into a pen and she": null, "almost made it incapable of walking. into a pen and she almost made it": null, "incapable of walking. Which would have been sort of the problem of,": null, "well...": null, "Jaysohn: Yes, Grandma!": null, "Ava: Yes!": null, "Jaysohn: Okay, we don't have to high five. Watch out, she's gonna break": null, "your hand. My hand is broke.": null, "Erika: I slap it.": null, "Jaysohn: Ah! Good one, Grandma!": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna take the hand and say,": null, "Tula:\u00a0I can fix that.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And I'll drop a point of Lay on Hands.": null, "Aabria: What does it look like when you do that?": null, "Brennan: I touch my little snoot and do a little lick, which I normally": null, "do when I'm grooming my kids. A little blue.": null, "Aabria: You do that and he looks at you. And just watches very intently": null, "your face and not his hand. And goes,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0oh. Thank you very much.": null, "Lila: Ugh.": null, "Bennett: [Aabria] I understand.": null, "Thorn: Quite an impressive organization that you have here.": null, "Bennett: He's with you too, yes?": null, "Tula: Yes, this is the children's uncle, Thorn.": null, "Bennett: Right, and you and he... Can you all do the lightning move that": null, "he did?": null, "Tula: Thorn's gifts are his own.": null, "Bennett: Sure.": null, "Thorn: But each of us are uniquely gifted with the Blue.": null, "Lila: I can read!": null, "Bennett: Good. That's very good.": null, "Jaysohn: And I can do this.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0And I'm up on a rock and just do a cool jump. (laughing)": null, "Aabria: You know what, Sybil's right there like (awkwardly clapping).": null, "There's like two people on the ground that were like almost falling": null, "asleep like. We're clap-? No, a boy did a trick.": null, "Ava: Good, Jaysohn. I don't know what read is.": null, "Bennett: When you see symbols and you can understand their meaning.": null, "Jaysohn: Is that what you were doing back there? Impressive.": null, "Bennett: The symbols are 'writing'. The ability to understand them is": null, "'reading'.": null, "Ava: Why do they have one for different bits? Shouldn't it be like": null, "reading and...": null, "Tula: Grandma, these stoats have an entire culture. We don't need to": null, "correct the mistakes that they're making with their culture within": null, "minutes.": null, "Ava: But we have our culture.": null, "Tula: I understand, but...": null, "Ava: Our culture is great.": null, "Tula: Giving notes on a concept you just got a moment ago.": null, "Ava: Well, I don't know what 'read' is, but I'm pretty sure I'm not": null, "gonna cotton on to it, no.": null, "Bennett: Huh, interesting.": null, "Jaysohn: Me neither, Grandma. (chuckling)": null, "Viola: So what happens now after you've put the animal in its pen? Now": null, "how do you spend the rest of your day?": null, "Bennett: Oh, well, we will tend to our injured and I think everyone here": null, "has deserved a nice, long rest. This squadron will be relaxing for the": null, "next couple days until we have new orders.": null, "Thorn: Squadron, I like that word. Make sure Lukura, when we set out": null, "again, just I like that name--": null, "Bennett: What is Lukura? It's fine, do you wanna come inside? Are you": null, "okay?": null, "Thorn: Fantastic.": null, "Tula: Let's get some food for Jaysohn and Lila.": null, "Thorn: Jaysohn will start attacking things.": null, "Bennett: It looks like your mother had food.": null, "Siobhan playfully \u201cfalls asleep\u201d into Brennan\u2019s arms.": null, "Tula: And there's the crash. And there's the crash.": null, "Thorn: There it is.": null, "Tula: He shouldn't do a (whispered) rock jump (normally) when he's": null, "hungry. He's gonna need a nap. (laughing)": null, "Aabria: And I do think, I just wanna like extra point out for those of": null, "you who didn't see it. Like, you see these massive packed cylinders with": null, "straps to be put on their back with like little prods on the side. And": null, "they're just sort of at rest next to.": null, "Rashawn: Can I sniff around that, if it smells--": null, "Aabria: There's people laying there. So that's like going up to": null, "someone's backpack at Coachella and being like, can I smell your bag?": null, "Which you can do, but.": null, "Rashawn: Do you have water?": null, "Erika: I absolutely do that. I see you interested and I'm like, oh yes.": null, "Rashawn: Yeah, I kind of use my mom as like a, yeah, you go first and": null, "she'll be distracting them and I can look through the bag. Or look at": null, "the bag.": null, "Ava: Look at this, Viola.": null, "Aabria: Oh, you wanna inspect this?": null, "Rashawn: Yeah, I do.": null, "Aabria: Sure, you get in close. You've gotta give me a persuasion check.": null, "Some sort of charisma cause,": null, "Rashawn: Coitantly. (certainly, pronounced weirdly)": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yeah, there's just a little stoat.": null, "Rashawn: You said persuasion?": null, "Aabria: [Aabria] Yes.": null, "Rashawn: Huah! Oh. What's 17 plus four?": null, "Aabria: 21.": null, "Rashawn: That many.": null, "Aabria: With a 21 you see just a little plain, brown stoat with a white": null, "bib kind of laying on their back. Opens up one eye. Sees the pack, sees": null, "you. And more importantly looks up at Bennett who you see gives them an": null, "imperceptible like, (under breath) It's fine.": null, "Viola: I'm allowed to be here. (laughing)": null, "Aabria: \u201cOkay.\u201d And just rolls unto their side. And gives you a little": null, "wide berth to look at that.": null, "Rashawn: I check it out. I wanna look at the cylinder. Like, there was a": null, "prod part, but the thing that's strapped to their back.": null, "Aabria: Sure, give me an investigation check.": null, "Rashawn: Seven.": null, "Aabria: This is big and made of a material that I think you've only seen": null, "once or twice in your life. There's been little scraps of metal that": null, "you've come across. Like, you've seen scraps of glass that you used to": null, "dry out the jerky and scraps of metal that you've sharpened on rocks": null, "down by the river to turn into rudimentary tools. You've never cared": null, "about too much because what is a tool against the things you were born": null, "with.": null, "Rashawn: Tools.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, so this really feels like an incoherent thing. Like, you": null, "understand that there is a cool result with no sense of how it": null, "functions.": null, "Rashawn: Okay, another thing I was thinking about.": null, "Rashawn: Is this the place that I saw in my visions, since I was seeing": null, "all of these stoats jumping around happy in my vision. Is this, have I": null, "come to the promised land?": null, "Aabria: You had a very strong sense of being surrounded by gray rock.": null, "And this sort of outcropping of rock doesn't look correct. But the more": null, "you think about it, that sort of smooth, uninterrupted pale gray does": null, "look like what you saw in your vision.": null, "Rashawn: I think that just makes Viola a little bit more aware. Like": null, "giving her sister a look of like, there's some suspicion I have looking": null, "to my mother and being like, I don't think we can rock in here the way": null, "that we think we can. We kind of have to be accommodating and adaptable": null, "to their culture. Honoring ours and accepting of theirs. But I've got,": null, "my ears are kind of up.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to make an insight check against, not against, but": null, "into Bennett. As I see that he appears to command a little bit more": null, "status than any of the stoats that we've met.": null, "Aabria: Please do.": null, "Jasper: Can I, because I feel like I've seen Tula do this to me.": null, "Aabria: Ha, ha, ha!": null, "Jasper: Like, when I'm in the middle of a conversation, I could just see": null, "Tula like burrowing. Can I be in a conversation with Bennett sort of": null, "asking him about the hunt and everything like that?": null, "Aabria: Absolutely.": null, "Jasper: Trying to give the... Kind of get him to talk a bit more, so I": null, "can give the help action.": null, "Aabria: 100%, for sure. And Bennett immediately turns to you and just,": null, "sure, engages in conversation.": null, "Jasper: We're kind of comparing hunting notes.": null, "Bennett: Yeah, oh yeah. The thing you did was amazing and I'm deeply": null, "grateful that you saw that. I can't believe I missed it. And yeah, is": null, "lost with you.": null, "Brennan: 28.": null, "Aabria: Golly.": null, "Siobhan: (whisper) That's my mom.": null, "Brennan: I'll give Thorn a little thing of like, I see you helping me.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you sort of take in the leader of this hunt. He's just a": null, "little bit larger than any of the stoats, even young Walmer back at your": null, "warren. With like, tawny brown fur. And a stripe down the center of his": null, "back where everything's beginning to go like ermine winter white. He's": null, "got just a little bit of like scarring around his ear and on his face.": null, "And right by his lip. So it makes it look, especially while he's": null, "talking, when he gets really excited and no longer controls all the": null, "muscles of his face, his smile looks a little bit like a sneer as it": null, "pulls up where the scar is. And yeah, what are you looking for? What do": null, "you want to know?": null, "Brennan: Soft eyes. I just want, everything always comes back to danger": null, "and fear.": null, "Brennan: Should I be afraid of this person? And are his intentions bad?": null, "And if you\u2019ll allow on a 28, subheading, does he wanna smash?": null, "Aabria: Yeah!": null, "Jasper: Ho, ho, ho!": null, "Erika: That's my girl!": null, "Rashawn: Let's get a little comfortable.": null, "Jasper: She's been around these woods!": null, "Brennan: I'm not hooking up. Knowing whether a guy wants to smash or not": null, "has lots of other uses. Valuable across the board. (laughing)": null, "Jasper: Uh-huh.": null, "Aabria: And I'm going to break my own heart by answering in the order of": null, "importance and not of what I find most interesting. You should be afraid": null, "of him, he is a fearsome thing. But as a group, don't have a reason to": null, "fear him. I think you have a sense, very immediately of hierarchy. Like,": null, "he is physically imposing and obviously good at what he does. And you": null, "know that stoats have died in this effort and he's walking it off. That": null, "the thing that he is a part of that he leads and represents is dangerous": null, "by virtue of him being at the front of it and fine. There is again that": null, "idea of like, violence and order and the organization of ferocity that": null, "he doesn't have to be scared or scary or worry about any of you. He": null, "didn't size you up as a threat. Now, did he size you up the other way?": null, "You're damn right he did.": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Yeah!": null, "Erika: Yes-suh!": null, "Aabria: And the moment where you healed him, there was that perfect": null, "blend of, he was deeply impressed by your gift, your willingness and": null, "efficacy in using it, and a moment of kindness that like, I think he,": null, "you get the sense that he's used to people doing what he needs or says,": null, "but an offered act of kindness beyond an order was special to him.": null, "Anything else? You can ask one more question.": null, "Brennan: Do I get any sense of, I guess, the last thing I'd be looking": null, "for. I don't know that cruelty is something that I would have the": null, "history or knowledge of given the family group that I've grown up with.": null, "Like, that type of cruelty to strangers, but is he aggressive?": null, "Aabria: Hm. No.": null, "Brennan: Okay.": null, "Aabria: I think there's that sense of like, big dogs seldom bark.": null, "Brennan: [Brennan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Aabria: That he's just very much at rest, and all of this is fine and": null, "easy.": null, "Brennan: I think the same reason that I just sort of abruptly was like,": null, "we should leave, when we saw the rabbits is I'm seeing something where": null, "I'm like, in a land with all this food, why would you all be this": null, "frightening? And I think that it's just, I can't get away from how good": null, "these people are at violence, when the only justification for violence": null, "I've ever seen is needing to survive.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. I think you are a little bit staggered by that. But then": null, "at the back of your mind there is that sense of like, the only reason to": null, "be that violent is in the face of a threat to survival. And if there is": null, "no cruelty here, there is no delight in this. Then there must be": null, "something they are trying to survive against. It's just not apparent": null, "yet.": null, "Aabria: And he turns and goes,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0okay, we're gonna get you food there, good. Sybil, you're good?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0She kind of nods.": null, "Bennett:\u00a0Okay, do you guys wanna come with me?": null, "Jaysohn: Yes.": null, "Bennett: [Aabria] Sure.": null, "Thorn: Thank you.": null, "Aabria: And he's going to lead.": null, "Izzy: Was that Sybil or Bennett?": null, "Aabria: No, that was Bennett.": null, "Aabria: I mean, Sybil's gonna give you like a little bye wave.": null, "Brennan: Ha, ha!": null, "Jaysohn: Bye, I love you.": null, "Lila: Bye, love you.": null, "Sybil: Oh.": null, "Lila: Not as much as my mom.": null, "Sybil: Oh my gosh, well, that's fair. That makes perfect sense.": null, "Jaysohn: You can come...": null, "Lila: Hang out, yeah.": null, "Tula: If you want to come see them later, you're welcome to.": null, "Sybil: Oh sure. Well, I don't know where you're gonna be. But if you go": null, "down a blue corridor. Fourth tunnel, and then on the eighth level to the": null, "right. Well, I think if you just get to the blue corridor and then you": null, "just yell very loudly, Sybil, I will find you or my friends will.": null, "Lila: What's a corridor? I'll yell Sybil.": null, "Jaysohn: We'll find you.": null, "Sybil: Yeah. Yeah.": null, "Thorn: (deadpan) They're incredibly good at tracking things down. I'm": null, "sure they'll find you.": null, "Sybil: Terrifying. Okay, thank you. And thank you again for not letting": null, "me... That would have been bad, so thank you.": null, "Viola: You're so welcome. I don't want anybody to perish at all if I can": null, "help it.": null, "Aabria: She's gonna go and kind of curl up on herself and just is gonna": null, "take a little rest out on this grass. And Bennett will lead you. I think": null, "he gets really quiet. And is sort of assessing and just sort of doing": null, "like, you can see mental checklists of okay, is everything taken care": null, "of. Like, am I forgetting anything before I go inside? He's going to": null, "lead you to the rabbit pen. They're not gonna bother you. And as Bennett": null, "steps forward these rabbits jump back and away from him.": null, "Bennett:\u00a0Like if you just wanna... And the hole. But if you wanna...": null, "Actually, we can just kind of grab one of them on the way? You know": null, "what, I got it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And he like ducks in and is going to, he goes from like casual": null, "and trying to explain to just lightning fast grabs a rabbit and grabs it": null, "by the back of the neck. And then, it's not just a bite. But you see he": null, "reaches across with his hand and snaps the rabbit's neck. And then is": null, "just going to start walking, again, upright, bipedal and is dragging it": null, "aside like,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0I got it. If you just want to follow me whenever you're... You": null, "good?": null, "Ava: Can you teach me?": null, "Jaysohn: I don't know how to do that, teach me.": null, "Lila: Can we get three more?": null, "Bennett: You want, I'm sorry?": null, "Tula: You're not gonna be able to finish three more rabbits.": null, "Jaysohn: Nah, I think we will, we will.": null, "Tula: No, I know you feel that way cause you're just really, really": null, "hungry. But you will get a little bit into this rabbit and then be full.": null, "Jaysohn: I can eat more rabbits than Lila.": null, "Viola: Family style.": null, "Bennett: Yeah, sure.": null, "Viola: Like a buffet or something like that?": null, "Aabria: Give me a persuasion check. I'm going to give you advantage,": null, "because I know your charisma's shit, but like, you do have a good": null, "rapport with him at this point.": null, "Erika: Yeah! Okay, all right. That's 10.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, with a 10 he's like,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0weird. Uh... Can I have a berry?": null, "Ava: Oh, yes! Of course, yes, yes.": null, "Aabria: Sweet. And you see he's still dragging and he kind of grabs it.": null, "I'm not gonna put it in my mouth, cause I don't wanna talk with it in my": null, "mouth. And just sort of throws it in his mouth, and says,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0go grab one. Get like a smaller one.": null, "Ava: Oh.": null, "Bennett: It's easier with a smaller one.": null, "Erika: All right. And I...": null, "Aabria: Give me an attack roll.": null, "Aabria: We'll make it like a grapple check. So attack roll with your": null, "little hands.": null, "Erika: My little hands. 13 plus like, that\u2019s a dirty 20.": null, "Aabria: Dirty 20. You're able to lunge out and grab one of the older": null, "rabbits that was just like, do, do, ah, shit!": null, "Ava: Come here!": null, "Aabria: But he doesn't say that. The rabbits can't talk. And he's like,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0okay, okay, okay. Good, got it? So you want right under the": null, "jaw. You know, where it gets kind of soft? Grab there. Up and towards": null, "your shoulder very quickly.": null, "Ava: Ah! Ah!": null, "Izzy: Head off.": null, "Aabria: Give me an athletics check. Your threshold is a 17 to get it on": null, "the first try.": null, "Erika: Oh, 14.": null, "Aabria: Oo, it's gonna get a little nasty, because you hear the pop and": null, "it just starts scream. (squealing)": null, "Aabria: And he's just like,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0okay, okay. That's a good first effort.": null, "Ava: What is it doing? What is it doing?": null, "Bennett: Notice how it's not moving below the waist anymore, so just one": null, "more time. One more time.": null, "Ava: Okay, ah!": null, "Bennett: Double pull.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You don't even have to roll for it. (squealing continues)": null, "Lila: Can we just leave her here? (squealing stops) Can we just go?": null, "Tula: No, she'll keep trying.": null, "Thorn: [Jasper] She'll keep practicing.": null, "Siobhan: I'm unblinkingly staring at it.": null, "Ava: Shh, shh.": null, "Bennett: No one gets it on the first one.": null, "Ava: Ugh.": null, "Bennett: So that was pretty good. That was really good. Ava?": null, "Ava: Yes.": null, "Bennett: And you're not single?": null, "Ava: Oh!\u00a0Ha, ha, ha! Yes, yes, I'm very single yes.": null, "Aabria: And you see him sort of freeze with this rabbit by the scruff as": null, "he's like backing into a little stoat tunnel and kind of gives you a": null, "Erika: And I smile. (smiling widely)": null, "Bennett: Eh, I don't know.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And pushes back in. So yeah, you get led to this small hole in a": null, "cement wall. Do you all follow?": null, "Rashawn: Yeah.": null, "The cast nods in agreement.": null, "a: Sweet, you get in and you find yourself on the inside of this just": null, "truly massive cement structure.": null, "The backdrop changes behind the players and Aabria.": null, "Erika: Ah!": null, "Rashawn: The stairs!": null, "Erika: Oh my god! Oh my god.": null, "Jasper: Okay. Okay.": null, "Brennan: Okay, okay.": null, "Aabria: And you see just sort of a little walkway, like catwalk looking": null, "out and over a massive internal, the word you have for it is just a": null, "single burrow within a bigger warren. But it goes up higher than any of": null, "you have ever climbed. And out farther than any of you have ever looked": null, "from a flat surface. It just extends in every direction. And it's": null, "covered with ladders and pipes of various sizes that are either painted": null, "to match the sort of drab gray of the cement or painted in vibrant": null, "shades of orange and red and blue and run into the walls and out of the": null, "walls. You see large rust drip marks as places where water has seeped": null, "into this have dried over time. And out on the ground and up on the": null, "walls in structures both clawed in and made and formed in structures": null, "both clawed in and made and formed and that have already existed there.": null, "More stoats than you thought were ever in the world.": null, "Aabria: Just in front of you now, those of you who just learned what a": null, "'thousand' is. Maybe 2,000 stoats milling around. Each one of them with": null, "a small strip of ochre fabric at their waist, purposefully moving": null, "towards things, away from things. And before you get down and into it,": null, "Bennett kind of moves to the side and drags the rabbit away and gives": null, "you a little private moment on this catwalk. And looks over and says,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0welcome to Last Bast. If you wanna acclimate for a minute, I": null, "understand. And you have two rabbits. And he kind of just drops his and": null, "nudges it towards you.": null, "Jasper: Thorn's paternal instincts kicking in, without even looking away": null, "I just put a hand on Jaysohn's shoulder and just say,": null, "Thorn:\u00a0no jumping. (laughing)": null, "Siobhan: I'm just looking at the rabbits in that way that like, you know": null, "a kid on Christmas morning and the presents are there, but you're not": null, "allowed to open them yet.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna look at Jaysohn and Lila and look at Bennett and I'm": null, "gonna say,": null, "Tula:\u00a0go ahead and eat, sweetie.": null, "Siobhan acts out attacking the rabbits.": null, "Bennett: Whoa.": null, "Viola: How big were the rabbits that you drove out of this burrow?": null, "Bennett: Ha, ha, ha! Sorry, I'm so sorry. This was not a rabbit burrow.": null, "Tula: Badger?": null, "Thorn: Oo.": null, "Bennett: No.": null, "Viola: [Rashawn] A big bear?": null, "Jasper: Thorn fully sits back and is like.": null, "Jasper stares, dissociating.": null, "Lila: Skin?": null, "Thorn: Yes. Um...": null, "Bennett: Human.": null, "Thorn: What's that? Hm?": null, "Aabria: And Bennett once again pushes himself up to standing and rests": null, "and kind of tucks his claws inside of this little sash belt. And says,": null, "Bennett:\u00a0they walk on two feet. They're monsters.": null, "Viola: And you're not afraid?": null, "Bennett: No. That's what all of this is for. That's what all of this is": null, "about.": null, "Thorn: I knew it.": null, "Izzy: And... Lila is looking at the sash and she's very smart. She's": null, "looking at it and she goes\u2026": null, "Lila:\u00a0I think I could crumple that up in a way. Maybe put it on Auntie's": null, "head. (laughing)": null, "Aabria: Give me...": null, "Rashawn: Smartest little girl in the world.": null, "Aabria: Smartest girl that's ever existed. Go ahead and give me an": null, "intelligence, just a raw intelligence check.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna give the help action. (laughing)": null, "Izzy: Uh...13.": null, "Aabria: You're sort of staring at it. And you're like, oh. If you could": null, "put that there, you could put that anywhere. And as you're sort of": null, "putting it together, like, Bennett catches your eye because he sees you": null, "sort of staring at him. He doesn't move away from being bipedal, but": null, "just sort of crouches a little bit unto his haunches to get a little": null, "closer. Like, he can't get closer to your height. He's bigger than any": null, "stoat you've ever seen. But begins addressing you--": null, "Izzy: This is hot.": null, "Aabria: Begins addressing you, but also the entire group. (rumbling)": null, "(cast gasping)": null, "The backdrops animate falling pieces of the building.": null, "Erika: No, no, no!": null, "Rashawn: What does that mean?": null, "Bennett: Before the beginning, there was darkness.": null, "Siobhan: Puppets.": null, "Bennett: We found the light ourselves. And began the world. (cast": null, "shushing each other) So many new things were illuminated. Opportunity,": null, "reason, technology, power. But light also begets shadow. And from those": null, "dark corners monsters grew. They stalk, ever expanding towards us.": null, "Towards what we have rightfully claimed. Towards what we have built.": null, "Towards the things that we seek to protect, each other, the Light": null, "itself. If they breach our walls, they will snuff out the Light. Because": null, "it is in darkness that they thrive. The shadows approach. We see it in": null, "the crushed clover. We feel it in the tremble of the earth itself. We": null, "feel it in the thunder on a cloudless day. This is the Last Bastion of": null, "the Light and we are its defenders. So we will work tirelessly together": null, "to prepare ourselves so that when the time comes we stoats will banish": null, "the darkness and its monsters. Forever. (clapping)": null, "Thorn: They did it, sweetie, they did it.": null, "Brennan: This show rules. Incredible.": null, "Viola: How long? How long have you had this stronghold?": null, "Bennett: Are you familiar with the way humans keep time?": null, "Viola: Uh, the sun comes up and it goes down?": null, "Ava: That's correct. The sun comes up.": null, "Bennett: And seasons come and go and we all turn white in the winter. 20": null, "winters ago. This place became ours.": null, "Ava: [Erika] 20!": null, "Viola: That's so long.": null, "Tula: Sorry, 20 winters ago?": null, "Bennett: Yes.": null, "Tula: How many winters have you seen, Mama?": null, "Ava: Four.": null, "Viola: I didn't think there was anything older than you.": null, "Ava: There wasn't.": null, "Tula: How... How can you possibly know that? It would have been, even if": null, "there were five... Of our whole families.": null, "Lila: You write it down?": null, "Bennett: We write it down. And if you can read it, there is so much we": null, "can show you.": null, "Ava: Maybe 'read' isn't all that bad.": null, "Thorn: Is there a place to read?": null, "Bennett: There is. You have food and safety. And fellowship. All within": null, "these walls. Welcome home.": null, "Thorn: Whew.": null, "Aabria: And that's where we're going to end today's episode.": null, "Jasper: No!": null, "Brennan: Woo!": null, "Jasper: [Jasper] Aabria Iyengar, wow!
