Go ahead and give me a Stealth check if you want to try": null, "to get out of his eye line and not skulk away, 'cause you're still": null, "sprinting, but just make it a little harder for him to pursue you as": null, "you're increasing the distance between the two of you.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, I'll definitely duck for as much cover.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0For sure.": null, "Brennan: As that bow comes out, I'm like, yeah, let's go towards where": null, "there is cover and obstruction.

That's a 12.": null, "Aabria: It's okay, you're able to kind of see that if you break off,": null, "there's a little bit of a downhill, and you're going to drop out of his": null, "eye line, so he's going to make this one last round of attacks with": null, "disadvantage.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Cool.": null, "Aabria: Actually, no. He's not even going to... You hear him stop": null, "running, and you never really looked over your shoulder, but you heard": null, "the difference in his footsteps. They got heavier, and though you didn't": null, "hear the clank of heavy plate, you understand the weightiness of a fully": null, "kitted soldier in full pursuit of you, but you hear the footsteps slow": null, "down.

You're a rogue": null, "now.": null, "Brennan: I am, but I'm not that good a rogue.": null, "Aabria: So you take half damage.": null, "Aabria: So you're going to take seven points of fire damage.": null, "Brennan: Mm.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Lou:\u00a0How doth Pnackleless stand?": null, "Emily: Pnackleless is good.": null, "Aabria: This could've been different.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, don't let the rogue-y stuff fool you, I am seven levels": null, "of fighter and barbarian, so I am largely uninjured. I have 66 of 94 hit": null, "points. I'm at 2/3 of my health. There is no swagger to that, it is just": null, "that my body, there's so much meat in my torso that the arrows are just": null, "sort of sitting in there, but I am deeply rattled and not in a": null, "comfortable, like, there is no swagger to, like, ha ha, you've only done": null, "31 points of damage to me! It's like, oh, I'm being murdered. I need to": null, "run as fast as I can.

You just see his right calf, and he": null, "turns and walks back into the woods.": null, "Brennan: I will just sprint as fast as I can, and I'm literally still": null, "going for a populated area.": null, "Aabria: Cool.": null, "Brennan: You know, just like\u2014and I think panicked, just still trying to": null, "find other people.": null, "Aabria: In an uncanny turn of events, because we did sort of leave with": null, "the Lords of the Wing pulling their luggage across a lawn with the rest": null, "of the group, I will have you happily run into the full cohort.

If": null, "anything, it's more of a chutney.": null, "Chirp: Yes, we like it salty.": null, "Major Hob: I know.": null, "Chirp: Savory, rather.": null, "Major Hob: There are some small seeds that seem to be doing some of the\u2014": null, "Squak: Fennel!": null, "Omar: As we're dissecting\u2014": null, "Major Hob: Fennel and boysenberry chutney. Are we sure we need to save": null, "as much of this?": null, "Chirp: Bird delicacy. Once you try it, you'll never want to eat anything": null, "else.": null, "Major Hob: Yes, a boysenberry with a nice licorice taste.": null, "Squak: Yes, a little annise under kick.": null, "[cast losing it over the jam bit]": null, "Surena: Jesus.": null, "Omar: I will 100% be distracted for a second by trying to understand the": null, "flavor profile of this chutney.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, of course.": null, "Omar: But after that, I would like to cast Cure Wounds.": null, "Omar: At level 2.": null, "Aabria: I'm going to say there is no check for it. You can absolutely do": null, "it. Go ahead and roll your healing.": null, "Omar: Okay.": null, "Aabria: But to everyone else, it is very obvious that Andhera is casting": null, "something on Hob right now.": null, "Chirp: Okay, I think it's clear that some spells are being cast, and I": null, "can only assume it's Message, and you're talking bad about us, which": null, "makes me just feel really hurt, right? Because we all just met up. Some": null, "of us are at the worst place that they've ever been in their life, and": null, "some of us are just badmouthing each other in their heads.": null, "BINX: I mean, I didn't get a message, if it makes you feel better.": null, "Rue: I didn't get a message.": null, "BINX: I didn't get a message, yeah.": null, "Squak: Well, that's what you would say if you got the message\u2014": null, "BINX: No no no, I didn't get a message!": null, "Major Hob: Lords of the Wing, I assure you, the only... Only message I": null, "received was the message that...": null, "Surena: I want to take a luggage, the unjammed luggage, and I want to": null, "put it in my wing.": null, "Brennan: And you cast Cure Wounds?": null, "Omar: Yeah, 10 points of HP goes back to you.": null, "Brennan: Awesome.": null, "Major Hob: Oh, thank you. Are they still in there? Look, I've been shot.": null, "BINX: What?": null, "Squak: By who?": null, "BINX: You've been shot?": null, "Major Hob: I've been shot. Are the arrows still\u2014": null, "Andhera: Yes.": null, "Major Hob: All right.": null, "Andhera: Do you want me to\u2014": null, "Major Hob: No no no no no! I am a walking crime scene. We must not": null, "interact. Do not pull the arrows out. This is proof!": null, "Chirp: Okay, okay. Maybe we should all go somewhere safe, where no one": null, "can see us.": null, "Major Hob: Yes.": null, "Chirp: And you can tell us more, and we won't be seen together, and no": null, "one will be wondering whether or not we got kicked out of our nest.": null, "BINX: You got kicked out of your nest?": null, "Squak: We did not get kicked out of our nest.": null, "BINX: Oh my god!": null, "Chirp: It's just logical that if we were outside of the nest, people": null, "would start to wonder, did they get kicked out of the nest?": null, "BINX: Right, what did you do to get kicked out?": null, "Major Hob: But of course, if you hadn't been kicked out of the nest, you": null, "would've packed more than jam and spoons.": null, "BINX: Right, that's true, that's true.": null, "Chirp: Well, you need the spoons to eat the jam.": null, "Rue: So you did get kicked out of your house.": null, "Squak: Now can we stop dwelling on the worst thing that's literally ever": null, "happened to us ever?": null, "Chirp: And by us, we mean all of us.": null, "Squak: All of us, and go eat jam at Andhera's place.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to head off to Andhera's place, yeah.": null, "Lou: Can I sidle up to Hob real quick on the walk over?": null, "Squak: Did you say you got shot with an arrow?": null, "Major Hob: Two.": null, "Squak: You'll have to describe that to me later, for something I'm": null, "working on.": null, "Major Hob: Well, certainly, I can describe that. I've been injured": null, "before in combat, so if you\u2014": null, "Squak: Specifically by a bow? Any chance the person you were fighting": null, "was a hunter of sorts?": null, "Major Hob: Bow and arrow is the weapon of a hunter, certainly, I assume,": null, "and in this manner, yes, the person that was arching at me, certainly we": null, "were not engaged in combat. It was more, to be truthful, it was like I": null, "was being hunted, certainly.": null, "Squak: You know what, I can't have this conversation anymore.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0": null, "Aabria: As you walk, I do need you to roll another d6. You dispelled": null, "that sort of part of that transformation, but there are other effects in": null, "that arrow.": null, "Brennan: 2.": null, "Aabria: 2\u00a0more points of damage, and you see that you're losing inches": null, "of that arrow. It's working itself farther into his back.": null, "Brennan: I'm looking around and being like,": null, "Major Hob: We must quickly call a summit of the courts of fairy and show": null, "them and say, hey, honorable members of the fey courts, the Prince": null, "Apollo of the Court of Wonder shot me twice in the back!": null, "Rue: Apollo shot you?": null, "BINX: Was it Prince Apollo?": null, "Major Hob: Two times in the back.": null, "Andhera: Captain, also, on top of that, the arrows are slowly making": null, "their way deeper into your body. I don't know how long we have to gather": null, "everybody.": null, "Major Hob: Do you think if we take 45 minutes to sort of circle up with": null, "everybody, that it will be okay, or\u2014": null, "Squak: Maybe they'll come out the other side by that point, and then,": null, "voila.": null, "Major Hob: Does it seem they are traveling towards a center, or is it": null, "just directional? If I kind of orient my organs such that\u2014": null, "Squak: Can you orient organs?": null, "Chirp: I certainly can.": null, "Major Hob: Well! I believe if we were in more ribald circumstances, the": null, "orienting of organs... [chortling heartily]": null, "Squak: I missed you.": null, "Major Hob: I missed you as well! If we are lucky and I survive the day,": null, "there will be... How are we all doing right now? Is everyone...": null, "Chirp: I certainly think that if we were able to go to Andhera's, I'd": null, "love to\u2014": null, "Aabria: I'm assuming you're all on your way, yeah.": null, "Emily: We're there.": null, "Lou: Fantastic.": null, "Emily: Yeah yeah yeah.": null, "Lou: Okay.": null, "Major Hob: So I was walking through the forest, and I was approached by": null, "Prince Apollo of the Court of Wonder and he came up to me and he said": null, "some threatening sort of banter, the types of which, no offense to your": null, "highness, but princes are often wont to say to sort of establish his": null, "superiority over me socially, as though that is any indication of what": null, "would happen if we were actually to scrap! But, his station being what": null, "it was, there was no chance for me to remain in the forest. Had I": null, "successfully managed to defend myself, I would be discovered over the": null, "prostrate body of a prince of the Court of Wonder, and that would be the": null, "end of my either life or freedom, I assume, and so I did what made the": null, "most sense to do, which was run.": null, "Rue: Are you hurt? How are you feeling?": null, "Major Hob: Oh.": null, "Rue: You seem very casual after being shot.": null, "Major Hob: Well, the prince's aim, let's just say that he was relying": null, "much too much on the draw of the bow, and so the arrows were coming": null, "straight. He did not arc. If he had been a better archer\u2014": null, "Rue: [emphatic]\u00a0How are you feeling? Are you hurt?": null, "Major Hob: It does hurt. But I dare not... I dare not move the arrows,": null, "lest we lose our proof that this has been done. I do not understand the": null, "politics of what this means. If they can be removed, and it is on the": null, "good word of these fairies herein assembled that we may make this": null, "accusation against the Prince Apollo, then that is all well and good,": null, "but if words are not enough, then I am happy to keep these wounds, that": null, "they may prove what we understand.": null, "Aabria: Let's go ahead and say that you were able to very quickly get": null, "back to Andhera's, so you guys are now sort of\u2014": null, "Surena:\u00a0Safe.": null, "Aabria: Safe and alone and secure. But I do need you to roll two more d6": null, "for me.": null, "Lou: Also, suitcase is open, spoons are laid out. If anyone wants.": null, "Emily: We're passing out\u2014": null, "Surena: I return the luggage from my wing, yeah.": null, "Rue: It's not that bad. It\u2019s actually quite\u2014": null, "BINX: Oh, it's nice, it's nice.": null, "Squak: Oh, all right.": null, "Chirp: You've been bit by the bird.": null, "BINX: It has like a little herbal thing going on.": null, "Squak: Yes.": null, "Surena:\u00a0I like it.": null, "Chirp: So, Captain Hob, I don't know what Prince Apollo's intentions": null, "with you were and how they fit into his other machinations, but I": null, "believe that reporting Prince Apollo's deeds to some other authority, I": null, "don't think would resolve in his chastisement, and in fact I think he is": null, "engaged in more grave deeds.": null, "BINX: The Court of Wonder and the Seelie Court, from my understanding,": null, "they're consolidating power. They're closing portals. They're shutting": null, "off the access to the mortal realm. That's why we're so few, because we": null, "straddle the line between the mortal realm and the fey realm, and if": null, "that access is closed, the magic also closes. But I think that if Alven": null, "knew, if Alven or the Court of Sea Foam knew what happened here, I do": null, "not believe they are aligned with the Court of Wonder.": null, "Chirp: Andhera, it's come to my knowledge through a betrothal to your": null, "sister that she is also pursuing this end.": null, "Andhera: I have it on good authority from my mother, the Queen of Air": null, "and Darkness, that my sister Suntar sucks.": null, "Major Hob: Your mother said that?": null, "Rue:\u00a0Your mother said that.": null, "Andhera: Not in those exact words, but, like\u2014": null, "Chirp: Can I just ask how that relates to this?": null, "Major Hob: I mean, good for you, you know.": null, "Squak: Never above a good dig.": null, "Andhera: She is acting outside of the specific jurisdiction of our": null, "court.": null, "Chirp: Oh, okay. Wonderful, then. I thought I was breaking something": null, "terrible to you.": null, "Andhera: No, in fact, if anything, that completely checks out.": null, "Chirp: Okay.": null, "Andhera: It would be in my interests as a representative of the Unseelie": null, "Court to actually forgo her plans and see what we could do to stop my": null, "sister from achieving what she's doing, especially if what you're saying": null, "is true, that they're trying to block off magic and hold it.": null, "BINX: Portals have been closing. I\u2014um, Gwyndolin\u2014Gwyndolin's on the": null, "other side right now, in the mortal realm, and she's\u2014": null, "Rue: What is she doing over there?": null, "BINX: Well, oh boy. Um, so, you know, when... She's sort of dating my": null, "warlock.": null, "Squak: Mm.": null, "Major Hob: Fun.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Messy.": null, "BINX: Yeah, I mean, and here's the thing with that, though.": null, "Chirp: Why do you say my warlock, huh? Am I sensing a love triangle?": null, "BINX: No!": null, "Chirp: Oh, okay, sorry, sorry.": null, "BINX: No, no no no, no worries. You know, they're my family. Scratch,": null, "Mika, and Gwyndolin, they're my family, and they're over there, and": null, "they're reporting that portals are closing, and if they close and we're": null, "not able to come back, or if they're not able to come back, that's when": null, "we fade. We fade. We turn into ideas. We turn into a feeling, the": null, "feeling you get when you go into an abandoned place, that tingle on your": null, "spine, that's what we become, and the more portals close, the more": null, "likely that is to spread to everyone else, I'm assuming. But the thing": null, "is, Apollo hurt you, and you're my family. So we need to figure this": null, "out.": null, "Aabria: Hob, I need you to give me a Constitution saving throw. Anyone": null, "looking at his back, the arrows are no longer visible.": null, "Brennan: That's going to be a 13.": null, "Omar: That's actually a 15, you're standing right next to me.": null, "Lou: And I'm gonna give you a Bardic Inspiration, because the jam is": null, "just that damn good.": null, "Emily: Can I also do an Arcana check to try and see what the heck is": null, "going on?": null, "Aabria: Please do.": null, "Emily: 12.": null, "Aabria: The best you can figure, there is some lingering effect on those": null, "arrows where it's not any factor of his moving, because now you're all": null, "inside, but they are just creeping into his body and looking to pierce": null, "something.": null, "Emily: Oh, seeking arrows.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Probably his heart.": null, "Brennan: With the inspiration, with the aura, 24.": null, "Aabria: Okay, the thing you feel on the inside of you is an arrow, a": null, "blade, meeting something important.": null, "Major Hob: All right, I wanted to preserve this evidence. If someone": null, "could dig these arrows out of my back, I would deeply appreciate it.": null, "Chirp: I'll do it.": null, "Major Hob: Sorry, is that your sword?": null, "Chirp: How else do I dig? What, get a shovel?": null, "Major Hob: Get a jam knife, at least. Here.": null, "Emily: Can I get it with a spoon?": null, "Squak: That's a silver jam knife. You will not, you will not.": null, "Chirp: A grapefruit spoon!": null, "Major Hob: All right, yes, a runcible spoon shall do.": null, "Aabria: Okay, are you doing\u2014you're just digging it out with a spoon?": null, "Oscar: Oh my god.": null, "Aabria: You have to\u2014I just need you to tell me to my face.": null, "Lou: I'm going to give you another Bardic Inspiration as I get behind my": null, "cousin.": null, "Squak: Cousin, you've got this. You've done way more impressive things": null, "with a spoon.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You're digging out a magical arrow with a spoon. I want that on": null, "the record. That's what you're doing.": null, "Emily: I have zero Medicine.": null, "Major Hob: I want you to know something.": null, "Lou: I have +4 Medicine.": null, "Squak: Give me the spoon! Give me the spoon!": null, "Chirp: Cousin, you know more about doctors that I do.": null, "Emily:\u00a0I wink.": null, "Major Hob: Lord Airavis, I want you to know that\u2014": null, "Major Hob: I have utter confidence in your medical ability.": null, "Squak: Please, believe me, I know a lot about EMTs. All right, here we": null, "go. Rue, would you mind giving me just a bit of help on this?": null, "Rue: Of course!": null, "Oscar: And then I'm rubbing your shoulders.": null, "Squak: Great.": null, "Rue: You got this.": null, "Aabria: Do you want to give a Bardic?": null, "Emily:\u00a0I'm braiding Rue's hair.": null, "Oscar: Yes, absolutely.": null, "Major Hob: Would it be helpful for research purposes if I describe the": null, "feeling as you were doing it for the movie?": null, "Squak: The movie?": null, "Major Hob: What?": null, "Squak: Motherfucker, do you know? Who the fuck told you?": null, "Lou is violently trying to get towards Brennan with Oscar holding him": null, "back.": null, "Squak: Who the fuck told you I was Airry Pearry?": null, "Chirp: Get him, cousin, get him!": null, "Squak: Who the fuck told you? Who squealed? Who the fuck squealed?": null, "[sound of wound squelching]": null, "Chirp: Cousin, get his other lung!": null, "[all shouting over each other] [Brennan panting]": null, "Squak: No, BINX is right, we're around family.

Let's do this. Just commit it to memory.": null, "Lou: All right, yeah, I get a +4 on Medicine.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, give me a Medicine check.": null, "Surena: Wait, can I give him one of my Lucky?": null, "Aabria: I'll happily allow you to give him Lucky. You're going to have": null, "to burn one of your tokens to move your magical effect over to someone": null, "Surena: Okay, we'll see how you do.": null, "Aabria: Oh, no no no, you decide now.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Okay, fuck, all right. I'm going to give you this, because I": null, "don't need to hide anymore.": null, "Surena hands Aabria the medal.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Beautiful.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Aw.": null, "Squak: Hey, we're all out in the open now. You're truly BINX. I'm also": null, "Airry Pearry.": null, "BINX: Airry Pearry, yes.": null, "Emily: Just so we can make this totally a medical scene, can I cast": null, "Arcane Eye and send it into his body and be like describing? That's how": null, "I'm giving him the help action.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh my god.": null, "Chirp: Okay, right now the spoon is\u2014okay, a little to the left.": null, "Squak: All right, all right.": null, "Chirp: A little to the left.": null, "Squak: Yes, okay.": null, "Omar: I come over with a bowl of water to be helpful that I purified.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Surena: Sterile.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Everyone's doing good stuff.": null, "Lou: I whisk the spoon around in that.": null, "Brennan: I think sterile doesn't mean disinfected.": null, "Emily: I put away the really dirty bowl of water we were using.": null, "Major Hob: Oh no, okay, all right, here we go.": null, "Chirp: Okay, cousin?": null, "Aabria: Just so you know, you're rolling with advantage, you have Bardic": null, "Inspiration, and the DC for this is now halved thanks to Lucky.": null, "Lou: Okay, incredible, so I got a 6 on the first one, but I'm going to": null, "do better on the second one, hi-ya! Nat 20!": null, "[cast cheering]": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Aabria: Amazing.": null, "Squak: Oh, the sequel is writing itself!": null, "Aabria: So I want you to describe what it's like for Lord Airavis to get": null, "in there and grab both of those arrows, and I'm going to add a little": null, "bit at the end.": null, "Lou: I think Lord Airavis, the reputation tag I'd like to give myself,": null, "if you'll give it to me, and it's a lot, but I would like to add \"Icon\".": null, "Aabria: Yes! Absolutely.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh my god!": null, "Lou: I think with the associations with Prince Apollo, with the fact": null, "that everyone is reading \"The Green Hunter,\" a recommendation he keeps": null, "giving, I think people are really looking to Squak now as a tone setter,": null, "as a taste maker, and I think that truly with that comes an unreal sense": null, "of confidence that's just like, well, of course I can do medicine. I": null, "wrote a poor EMT scene, of course I can use this jam spoon to remove two": null, "deeply embedded arrows that have punctured your left lung, and I just": null, "jam it in there.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ha, jam.": null, "Lou: Incredibly delicate movements, sharp, and I think it's just a": null, "feeling, hearing where it needs to go from Chirp.": null, "Chirp: A little to the left. Ooh, nice touch. Wow.": null, "Squak: Yes, yes, yes. There it is, there it is.": null, "Chirp: Oh, that spoon was made for your hand.": null, "Squak: Well, it literally was.": null, "Chirp: That's true. That's very true.": null, "Squak: It's got my monogram on the back, so this is one of mine.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yes, and your baby thumbprint.": null, "Squak: Oh god, yes, I forget. What a nice touch Grandfather\u2014": null, "Rue: Just get to it!": null, "Squak: Sorry. I think I'm hitting it. That's it right there?": null, "Chirp: That's it, yeah, perfect.": null, "Squak: All right. I'm going to scoop it out.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, scoop it.": null, "Aabria: I think you go to scoop it, and you realize very quickly,": null, "especially with a nat 20, you feel your hand moving towards something": null, "deeply arcane.": null, "[mysterious instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: So you kind of forego the spoon in that moment.": null, "Aabria: And move your grip to grab both the spoon handle and the shaft": null, "of the arrow simultaneously.": null, "Lou: Got it.": null, "Aabria: And you feel it pull back, and even as you pull it free from his": null, "flesh, you feel that last bit of magic sort of disapparate from it as it": null, "knows it's no longer able to fulfill its job, and you see, as you're the": null, "only one that can kind of see it before everyone else is able to, that": null, "there were tiny little feet on the edge of the arrowhead that were": null, "clawing forward like a millipede where it was crawling in.": null, "Lou: Disgusting.": null, "Aabria: And with a natural 20, I'm giving you that you can sort of smell": null, "and feel and you're deeply aware of the magical signature on that. You": null, "know that that was Prince Apollo's arrow. You already believed him, but": null, "you kind of have the only proof of it as these arrows go inert when they": null, "come free.": null, "Lou: But they are inert now.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Lou: So that's now just knowledge, this is no longer true.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes.\u00a0Those look like two completely normal arrowheads.": null, "Squak: Yeah, these bear Prince Apollo's signature. Dammit, I guess we're": null, "never going to have sex.": null, "Rue: What?": null, "BINX: Oh, was that a thing?": null, "Chirp: Cousin, you can have sex with people that you hate and disagree": null, "with.": null, "Squak: You're right, I've done it so many times.": null, "Chirp: And also, so many people have done it with us.": null, "Squak: Yes, true. But no, Prince Apollo has done you wrong, Captain Hob.": null, "Andhera: Captain, I'm sorry that you thought that you had to bear those": null, "wounds and burdens yourself. It seems that we are all aligned in all of": null, "our motivations to unseat this plan that seems to be hatching between": null, "the Court of Wonder and my sister.": null, "BINX: And you didn't know anything about it? You're learning all of this": null, "with us? You didn't know that your sister was closing portals?": null, "Andhera: No, and quite frankly, I'm not shocked, but I'm incredibly": null, "offended, and it would be my honor to not just restore your health\u2014": null, "Omar: And I would like to hold out my hand and actually Lay on Hands as": null, "much as you need, up to 40.": null, "Brennan: I second winded privately to myself, so I'm actually looking a": null, "little bit better than I was when I first showed up.": null, "Emily: There's something so weird about saying I privately second": null, "winded.": null, "Brennan: I didn't want to make a whole deal about it.": null, "Omar: Second winded.": null, "Brennan: I feel like you doing that surgery and me having a higher hit": null, "point total than when I showed up is like,": null, "Major Hob: I think there was some old shrapnel in my lung as well.": null, "Chirp: The Arcane Eye saw that there were a couple of things wrong, so I": null, "just kind of nudged a couple organs into alignment.": null, "Major Hob: Yeah, there was also a chiropractic adjustment.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Major Hob: I feel incredible.": null, "Brennan: If you have 21 to spare, I'll take that.": null, "Omar: That's yours.": null, "Lou: A healing wrist grab, a beautiful thing.": null, "Major Hob: Your highness. I thank you. I think we are all of a like mind": null, "here, with the exception of the estimable Delloso de la Rue. I wish only": null, "to ask because you remain, of those assembled here, a member of the": null, "Court of Wonder. I know your relationship to that court is a complicated": null, "one. However, this goes beyond simple investigation or rumor. We bring": null, "great charges against the prince of that court.

I was earlier approached by the Court of": null, "Wonder, and asked to be in a seat of power, to be a part of the Chorus.": null, "Rue: Yes, it seems like they want me in power so they can silence me.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Mm.": null, "Aabria: You hear a knock at the door.": null, "Squak: Ooh.": null, "BINX: Are you expecting visitors?": null, "Andhera:\u00a0Uh, I\u2014 [stammers]": null, "BINX: Do you have friends?": null, "Andhera: You're my friends.": null, "BINX:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Emily: I look under the door to see what shoes are there.": null, "Aabria: They're orthopedic, old-looking, boring shoes.": null, "Emily: I relay this to the group.": null, "Squak: Orthopedic, old-looking, boring shoes?": null, "Chirp: Is it Grandfather?

It is!": null, "Rue: You just screamed vinegar.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Vinegar!": null, "Squak: Well, someone asked what the difference between a jam and a": null, "chutney is, and it's vinegar!": null, "Chirp: You don't pack a suitcase full of chutney jam\u2014": null, "Major Hob: So sorry, so this has\u2014": null, "Chirp: And not know the difference.": null, "Major Hob: Boysenberry, fennel, and vinegar.": null, "Squak: Apple cider, it's slightly sweet, and you cook off the acid.": null, "Chirp: Yes.

Apple cider vinegar is\u2014": null, "Squak: God, you people are so poor!": null, "Aabria: Advisor, while shocked by the raucousness of this group, you": null, "see, he's kind of nodding along. He's like,": null, "Advisor:\u00a0Yeah, that's right.": null, "Andhera: Oh, is it actually vinegar?": null, "Squak: What, you didn't believe me?": null, "Advisor: I'm going to leave this with you.": null, "Aabria: And he hands like, a very fancy envelope. You see an invitation": null, "to the theater, the last big event of the Bloom, that's going to be this": null, "evening.": null, "Andhera: I just received an invitation. I imagine the rest of us did, as": null, "well.": null, "Chirp: Yes, so I would suggest we believe that something is going to go": null, "down at the theater that affects the closing of the portals, so as much": null, "as I love the idea of bringing charges against Apollo, we may want more": null, "secretive behavior.": null, "Andhera: That's so interesting. I was looking for both of you at the": null, "gala recently to gift something to the both of you, in particular.": null, "Squak: Oh.": null, "Andhera: But before I do that and present that.": null, "Squak: Oh?": null, "Andhera: Might I just say, this is not the Unseelie's plan. This is": null, "strictly my sister's, and it seems that we're all being divided up in": null, "the opposite way that the magic is being gathered and controlled, but": null, "the goal is the same. So at this moment, as the not just heir to the": null, "Unseelie throne, but someone who actually, deeply, really considers my": null, "position seriously, I would like to extend an invitation for all of you": null, "to join my court in whatever position you seek, not through marriage or": null, "familial relation, but it is my right to do so, and I think truly we are": null, "stronger together. Whatever resources I have at my disposal, they are": null, "now yours. And\u2014I'm sorry, Lord Airavis, are you crying?": null, "Squak: It's very sweet.": null, "Aabria: Andhera, I need you to essentially make a spell attack for me.": null, "Omar: Okay, yeah.": null, "Aabria: So roll plus your Charisma and Proficiency.": null, "Omar: Great. That is going to be a 12.": null, "Aabria: It\u2019s okay, extremely low DC. As you all feel this little pulse": null, "move through the room and it touches each of you very lightly at the": null, "foot as the gravity of the words and the strength with which he speaks": null, "on behalf of his court meets you, that an agreement to this is something": null, "true and binding. There's a lot of lip service that passes between fey,": null, "but he is speaking a deep and changing truth to all of you.": null, "Andhera: The way my magic works is when you're close to me, you can't": null, "get poisoned, charmed. You have strength against specific tests, and I": null, "don't think that's a mistake. I think that magic is an extension of the": null, "love that we have for ourselves, each other, and the world around us,": null, "and the idea of someone hoarding that and cutting that off from": null, "different realms, that offends me on a very deep level. And I speak as": null, "the prince of the Unseelie Court, welcome, in whatever capacity you'd": null, "like.": null, "BINX: And as much as I would love to accept, I am the last of my court,": null, "and being so, my court would die with me. I will decline, but in turn,": null, "would of course offer the same, as well, if anyone would want to join": null, "the Court of Craft here and now. If you find, even you, that the": null, "machinations of your own court become too much and you want a warm fire": null, "and you want to be swept away in stories and visit the mortal realm as": null, "much as you want, I would be so honored to have any of you.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Same. Give me a spell attack roll.": null, "Surena: 11. 11.": null, "Aabria: It\u2019s okay, again, this is a very low DC.": null, "Aabria: The same thing. But this one doesn't feel like a pulse or an": null, "aura. This is more the feeling of remembering something as you smell": null, "something that triggers a memory. None of you smell anything in": null, "particular, but you get that sudden connection between a thing you've": null, "forgotten and a thing you are currently experiencing, and that is the": null, "pulse of her magic as, in the same way, a true offer is being presented": null, "to you.": null, "Surena: Hm?": null, "Rue: I would like to say this.": null, "Squak: Oh, another invitation.": null, "Major Hob: I just need to set up that I don't have the authority to": null, "invite anybody to the Goblin\u2014": null, "Squak: Hob, you're next, you're next, you're next!": null, "Major Hob: I will get in a lot of trouble if I invite\u2014": null, "Squak: I want to catch a feeling, all right? I want you to put a feeling": null, "out there. There's kind of a trend going on.": null, "Major Hob: If you want to come to the goblin pagoda and hang out, you": null, "are welcome to do that, but I am not the guy. I'm not the guy.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Chirp: K.P.": null, "Squak: Well, you figure that out. Rue.": null, "Rue: I must make it very clear, we must all be on the same page here.": null, "What are we setting out to do, exactly?": null, "Chirp: The problem that I'm personally facing is that we are trying to": null, "keep all portals to the material plane open, because some of us have": null, "vested interests there, and we know that something is being set in": null, "motion tonight to permanently close them. However, I have\u2014we have": null, "struggled to find out the details.": null, "Squak: Though we have, me and my cousin.": null, "Chirp: Yep.": null, "Squak: Have been invited to sit alongside Apollo and Suntar at the event": null, "this evening.": null, "Major Hob: Quite interesting.": null, "Squak: So we will have access.": null, "Chirp: Quite fortuitous, yes.": null, "Major Hob: Quite an advantageous invitation.": null, "Squak: Well, we earned it.": null, "Chirp: No, we did. We're really hot.": null, "Major Hob: Yeah, absolutely, and I hope... Yeah.": null, "[Squak and Major Hob stammering at each other]": null, "Major Hob: I get it.": null, "Squak: We earned it, you know? We worked for it.": null, "Chirp: We did earn it, yes.": null, "Major Hob: For sure, yeah. That announcement came in response to sort of": null, "not\u2014": null, "Squak: The general, kind of the plan. Sorry, I took it selfishly. I was": null, "like, well, what, does he think I didn't work for this?": null, "Major Hob: I just said advantageous, which is\u2014": null, "Squak: I really went into it, all right? I'm not used to doing a group": null, "thing, okay? It's normally just me and my cousin.": null, "Rue: No one's attacking you, Lord Airavis.": null, "Lou mimes punching Oscar.": null, "Chirp: I didn't even take it personally, but I thought it was so fun.": null, "Major Hob: In the past 10 minutes, you've stabbed two members of the": null, "august council!": null, "Rue: Put the spoon down!": null, "Squak: Goddammit.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Everyone, get away from my cousin!": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Ah! Full swords!": null, "Aabria: We push out from this craziness and look at the window as the": null, "sun drops over the horizon, and we approach our evening and the last big": null, "event of the Bloom. Before we get to the theater, is there anything": null, "anyone would want to prepare or do in advance of arriving there?": null, "Emily: I definitely cast Mage Armor. Right before we get there, I'm": null, "going to cast, not ritual, regular cast Phantom Steed, but before we go,": null, "I do want to ritual cast Rary's Telepathic Bond.": null, "Aabria: Nice.": null, "Emily: So instead of a Bluetooth, it's a bluebird tooth. I'll just make": null, "all these little bluebirds that can kind of tuck into our ears, and it's": null, "basically so that we can communicate when we get to the theater.": null, "Aabria: There is a phantasmal bird inside everyone's ear?": null, "Emily: Yeah, mm-hm. It's uncomfortable.": null, "Squak: It doesn't hurt the bird.": null, "Chirp: It doesn't hurt the bird, it just hurts you.": null, "Squak: Really jam him in there, though.": null, "Chirp: Make sure he doesn't nest there.": null, "Aabria: So just a quick housekeeping, that's up to eight people. Is": null, "there anyone else you would want to loop in beyond these six?": null, "Chirp: Is there anyone else?": null, "Squak: Any other allies we'd like to pile on?": null, "Major Hob: Do you have an especially small bluebird?": null, "Chirp: If it's for a salt goblin, absolutely. Absolutely.": null, "Major Hob: Lieutenant Gorebladder.": null, "Gorebladder: Yes? Hi.": null, "Major Hob: Wonderful news, you are being promoted to captain.": null, "Gorebladder: The first captain in my family.": null, "Major Hob: How big of a bird could you fit in your ear?": null, "Gorebladder: Big as you got.": null, "Major Hob: Now, that's not true. So, now say something true.": null, "Aabria: He holds up his little fingies, and it's like half a centimeter.": null, "Emily: I try to get it into his ear without him eating it.": null, "Chirp: Come on, no no no, no no no, no no!": null, "Major Hob:\u00a0Gorebladder!": null, "Squak: Is it the worst if he eats it? What if it's in his stomach?": null, "Chirp: Oh, that's true. You can eat it.": null, "Aabria: He licks your finger a little, and it's weird. I'm sorry.": null, "Chirp: Ooh, salty. Like being kissed by the ocean.": null, "Aabria: Anyone else got something to do?": null, "Andhera: Before we begin tonight's festivities, I had these made for the": null, "two of you.": null, "Squak: That's right, the gift that you didn't give us that you then": null, "withheld, yes.": null, "Chirp: Yes!": null, "Andhera: With the intention the entire time of giving it to you.": null, "Squak: Of course.": null, "Andhera: This is the exact event, though, that I think this will be": null, "useful. Lady Chirp, I believe you were saying earlier that we need to": null, "create some sense of sort of chaos in order to get to the bottom of this": null, "plot, and you two embody what I believe to be the best parts of magic,": null, "which is the chaos. And as the fey try to control that, you two are the": null, "ones who are constantly enjoying the true benefits of magic, to the": null, "point where here, everyone is vying for power. I think, in my opinion,": null, "as someone who's watched you from behind many a pillar\u2026 [chuckles]": null, "Squak: Oh, pillar boy.": null, "Chirp: I loved watching you grow, kind of. Just a little wider on the": null, "other side.": null, "Andhera: And then I shot up in between the last, yeah.": null, "Chirp: Broad shoulders, broad.": null, "Andhera: Thank you, oh my god. Thank you. No one carries more fear at": null, "these events than the two of you, because no one's quite sure what the": null, "two of you are going to do. So I bestow to you each one Wand of Wonder": null, "that I asked the Court of Tricksters to make for you.": null, "Squak: Oh!": null, "Squak: All right.": null, "Andhera: It's difficult to say what will happen when you cast this, of": null, "course. It's a bit of a roll of the die. But I assure you that your two": null, "are the best wings to command these with.": null, "Squak: How does it work?": null, "Lou: I'm going to cast it on Andhera.": null, "Chirp: Me, me!": null, "Squak: No, on Andhera. Yeah, I'm just going to point it and flick it.": null, "Yeah, what happens?": null, "Aabria: There's so many ways to find out what a thing does, and I": null, "appreciate your naturalistic approach. One of your seven charges leaves": null, "this wand.": null, "Emily: Great.": null, "Major Hob: I thought we were sort of setting up a Chekhov's gun kind of": null, "situation.": null, "Aabria: I'm going to need a d100 roll, please and thank you.": null, "Lou: You got it.": null, "Major Hob: Show them a gun in act one, they have to take it off right": null, "away and fire it in act one.": null, "Emily: God, it's taking everything in me not to be like, \"Cousin,": null, "don't!\" And accidentally trigger it.": null, "Lou: 91.": null, "Aabria: All right.": null, "Oscar: Dang.": null, "Aabria: A burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30": null, "foot radius. Oh, well, that's going to catch everyone. I know you were": null, "aiming it at Andhera. All of you need to make a DC 15 con save.": null, "Lou: Oh, Andhera, that's so kind! Fwah!": null, "Emily: I got an 11.": null, "Omar: Technically you got a 13, because you're standing near me.": null, "Emily: Oh! I got a 13.": null, "Brennan: Technically, I got an 18.": null, "Aabria: Okay, you're okay.": null, "Omar: 16.": null, "Aabria: You're fine.": null, "Surena: 18.": null, "Aabria: You're good.": null, "Oscar: 16.": null, "Lou: Oh, do I have to do it as well?": null, "Aabria: Each creature.": null, "Lou: That's a natural 19 on the dice.": null, "Aabria: So literally just your loving cousin gets blinded for the next": null, "minute.": null, "Chirp: Ah!": null, "Squak: Oh, that was delightful, Andhera!": null, "Chirp: What? What happened, what happened?": null, "Squak: Cousin, didn't you see? It was a beautiful, colorful spectacle.": null, "Chirp: I think I got jam in my eyes.": null, "Squak: Oh, cousin!": null, "Major Hob: Delightful, in a very sort of bright, disorienting sort of": null, "way.": null, "Squak: This is very sweet of you, thank you.": null, "Chirp: Yes, thank you so much, wherever you are.": null, "Rue: Turn around, you're facing the wall.": null, "Squak: Chirp, turn around!": null, "Chirp: Ooh, okay.": null, "Andhera: You do remember it was me.": null, "Chirp: Sorry, I'm blinded.": null, "Andhera: Right. Right, but...": null, "Emily: I hug Hob.": null, "Major Hob: It's all right. You know in a bird, when you put a blanket": null, "over the cage, and they really\u2014": null, "BINX: It's nighttime. It's time to sleep.": null, "Major Hob: She doesn't remember it was you, because\u2014": null, "Squak: Chirp, Chirp!": null, "Chirp: Ah! Ah! Ah!": null, "Squak: Chirp, you're not alone. I know, I know, it's dark. This is": null, "normally how we fall asleep, but no.": null, "Aabria: Is there anything else anyone else wants to prepare in advance": null, "of going to the theater?": null, "Brennan: I will just walk alongside Delloso de la Rue and say,": null, "Major Hob: Multiple offers to join courts. After your rebuffing of the": null, "Chorus, do you imagine that you will remain in the Court of Wonder, or": null, "do you think one of the offers of the leaders of Craft and Unseelie\u2014": null, "Rue: Major Hob, I don't... I've already refused a seating with the Court": null, "of Wonder, and I was faced with what appeared to be a threat on my end.": null, "As far as I'm concerned, I'm an orphan in the fairy world, which is not": null, "unfamiliar to me. All this talk about courts and belonging, I feel torn,": null, "to be honest with you. There was a part of me that wanted to dismantle": null, "all courts.": null, "Major Hob: That would be chaos.": null, "Rue: Would it?": null, "Major Hob: Well, if there weren't courts, then how would you know what": null, "to do, or how to, you know... You wouldn't... Where would orders come": null, "from if not from one's obligations to court and kin?": null, "Rue: And for what? Why?": null, "[Major Hob stammers]": null, "Rue: I'm starting to realize something, that you and I are very": null, "different. I have done very brash things governed by my heart, while you": null, "have done things based on your court and your obligation. Ultimately,": null, "where does obligation land you? Are you truly happy with the things that": null, "you've done for the name of other people, for the wellbeing of others?": null, "Major Hob: We all act in the interest of others. It is not wrong. It is": null, "the basis of honor, and to act on one's self-interest alone is to lead": null, "an empty life, I think. I can only say that the other night, at the": null, "masquerade ball, you certainly acted in the interest of others. You": null, "showed me incredible kindness and made me forget the blundering of": null, "earlier in the Bloom. You took pity on someone whose clumsiness had": null, "earned them scorn and reprisal, and\u2014": null, "Rue: What made you think that was in the name of others? And what": null, "happens when doing something for others comes in direct conflict with": null, "the things that you want to do?": null, "Major Hob: I can see no alternative. Honor, responsibility, duty to": null, "one's court and kin has led... I would never have come here. I would": null, "never have met all these fine people if I had not acted on behalf and in": null, "service of a cause greater than myself. I became captain thanks to the": null, "actions I took on behalf of the Goblin Court, and I became Major only": null, "this morning when I agreed once again to serve the Goblin King.": null, "Rue: Well, I hope you find happiness in that. I really do.": null, "Oscar: And I turn and walk away.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Cousin.": null, "Squak: Yes?": null, "Chirp: I think Hob's been stabbed again. He looks so hurt!": null, "Major Hob: I've been stabbed in the corners of my eyes. Clear blood!": null, "Omar: I rush over.": null, "Andhera: I can Lay on Hands again.": null, "Major Hob: Just hold me. Just fucking hold me. Just fucking hold me.": null, "Andhera: Oh, oh. It\u2019s not\u2014I'm doing it, but it's bouncing back? I've": null, "never had this before.": null, "[Major Hob wailing]": null, "Andhera: What are you\u2014wait!": null, "Major Hob: It's still stabbing me! Everywhere!": null, "Chirp: Is it deep in your heart still? It seems to be coming from your": null, "heart.": null, "Major Hob: Yes, an arrow went straight to my freaking heart!": null, "Emily: I think while we're going in, I also, for my Phantom Steed, the": null, "reputation tag I want after everything that he just said is \u201cfearsome\u201d.": null, "Aabria: Let's go!": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Emily: And I'm going to, for my steed, I'm going to conjure a raven the": null, "size and shape of a flamingo. So, like, a long-legged raven.": null, "Surena:\u00a0A long raven. Long boy.": null, "Emily: And I'm going to fucking side saddle.": null, "Surena:\u00a0That is a long boy.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Yes!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Incredible.": null, "Brennan: If someone described the Lords of the Wing, I would assume that": null, "something was wrong with them. The mature and iconic Airavis, hospitable": null, "and fearsome Featherfowl. Sit down. Are you okay? Who are you": null, "describing?": null, "Omar: Your forehead is warm.": null, "Aabria: I keep blacking out between all these descriptors. Well then, we": null, "sort of follow the camera along this long boy as she sort of crests.": null, "Emily: Goes up a raven leg.": null, "Aabria: It's so bad to think about.": null, "Lou: It just keeps going.": null, "[regal piano music]": null, "Aabria: And you reach another one of these beautiful place between": null, "places, where you're very clearly no longer on the island that you've": null, "called home for the last few weeks. You see rolling hills and the": null, "beautiful ruins of an ancient Greek amphitheater, and attached to it,": null, "strung up and held by vines and orchids and flowers, are curtains of a": null, "red so piercing that it seems to desaturate the world around it, and as": null, "you move down, there's beautiful, cracked, ruined stone seating for": null, "everyone to sit and find their places facing the stage. Maybe 70% of the": null, "fey courts are already here, and as you move to wherever you all choose": null, "to sit, alliances new and old, you see that despite the mild,": null, "night-blooming jasmine scented air, suddenly the curtains begin to whip.": null, "With a sudden snap, they go from that beautiful red to a deep and": null, "piercing hunter green, and in the sky overhead, you see the stars begin": null, "to twinkle brighter, and then silvery light connects them in": null, "constellations that read out, \"The Green Hunter.\" The play for the": null, "night.": null, "Oscar: It's a sponsored post.": null, "Chirp: Did you do that, cousin?": null, "Lou: Did I do that?": null, "Aabria: No.": null, "Squak: I did not do it.": null, "Aabria: And even as you're whispering, something appears in your hand.": null, "Aabria hands a parcel to Lou.": null, "[Brennan gasps]": null, "Lou: Is this being passed to me?": null, "Aabria: Yes, I'm not going to reach up and over.": null, "Oscar: The Daily.": null, "Brennan: The rushes, the rushes!": null, "Lou: The hell?": null, "Aabria: It's well-wrapped.": null, "Emily: Cousin, use your beak.": null, "Lou: Yeah, of course.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0How cool must it be to get gifts from someone who works in the": null, "art department?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Right?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Beautiful, unbelievable.": null, "Omar: That paper alone.": null, "Lou: They wrapped it twice.

Wow, incredible.": null, "Surena:\u00a0It's gorgeous.": null, "Lou: God, I'm sending this straight to Jeremy.

What's going on?": null, "Rue: No, it's quite fine. I actually wanted to take a moment to myself.": null, "BINX: Oh. Oh, is it about... Okay, so you know how we're friends?": null, "Rue: Yes.": null, "BINX: You know how in friendships, there's this loyalty where I don't": null, "reveal things about you, even if they might be in your best interest?": null, "Because it's a secret, and the loyalty that I have for you is really": null, "deep, you know what I mean?

Have you talked to Hob lately?": null, "Rue: Major Hob?": null, "BINX: Yes, Major Hob, which, when did that happen?": null, "Rue: I don't know, he said it.": null, "BINX: Right, I heard it, but I didn't think to ask.": null, "Rue: I don\u2019t know if it was an official thing.": null, "BINX: Yeah yeah yeah.": null, "Rue: It doesn't matter, he tends to do that sometimes.

No, no no no. I think he's quite clear about his": null, "intentions with me, and I'm fine.": null, "BINX: So you don't like him anymore.

Fighting for other people's love is what I": null, "do. It's what I'm doing now. It's what I'm doing with Gwyndolin and": null, "Scratch.

I": null, "can't believe it.": null, "Oscar: Actual Jeremy Renner!": null, "Aabria: But your bloom, Hob, you hear low and, distinct from the waves": null, "around you in this area, the sound of the shore, and you know this is a": null, "message from the Court of Sea Foam, and you hear a voice that says,": null, "Sea Foam Message: We found one more scrap of something.

Listen.": null, "Lady Sylmenar, you must excuse me for a moment.

I'm sorry.": null, "Major Hob: Delloso de la Rue?": null, "Aabria: And they break eye contact with you and nod and look back at the": null, "stage.": null, "Brennan: Do I know if that means that everything we feared about the": null, "Court of Wonder, the breaking of the marriage to the viscountess, all": null, "that stuff, that seems to be confirming that they found something to": null, "suggest it was Rue the whole time?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, that would be the implication. There's nothing to roll": null, "there.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to look around for Rue. We have the\u2014": null, "Surena: Mm-hm.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to contact BINX and Andhera and say,": null, "Major Hob: Hello, do either of you have eyes on Delloso de la Rue?": null, "BINX: Yeah, yeah, right now.": null, "Omar: My teeth chatter.": null, "Surena: Yeah, my teeth are chattering.": null, "Major Hob: Sort of where are you?": null, "BINX: We're by the cliff side.": null, "Rue: What's happening?": null, "Major Hob: Hold onto them for one second.": null, "Surena: You see us just chattering.": null, "Rue: Who are you talking to?

Right": null, "now, the odds are 11 to 1, so, you know.": null, "Chirp: I have no\u2014I'm sorry, I'm so rich, I have no concept of how much": null, "money I have. That's kind of a rich person thing.": null, "Fey: Okay, I totally understand.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, yeah, so just-": null, "Fey: You have to give me a number, and then we kind of make a fey": null, "bargain about it, so we would have to-": null, "Chirp: Yeah, I know, it's just when you're so rich, like I am, I don't": null, "know if $100 is a lot or a little.": null, "Fey person: What the fuck is a dollar?": null, "Chirp: Sorry, I'm in the material plane.

That's all I needed, was just a sense of": null, "currency.

Yeah, anyway, and she kind of goes up and she's": null, "going to touch where you're holding it. She says,": null, "Fey: Okay, so you understand this is a fey bargain, right? If you welch": null, "on your bet, it's going to be a whole thing, and I do have to give a": null, "little insignia that you've entered into the wager. You can cover it up": null, "with a glamor or magic as you are wont to do, but hold still.": null, "Aabria: And she kind of touches, and these sort of lurid pink,": null, "flamingo-y, prawn-y feathers spring up around your wrist.": null, "Chirp: Gorgeous. I wouldn't have picked it out for myself, but I love": null, "what you did.": null, "Fey: Sorry. Trickster Court.": null, "Chirp: Great. Oh, big fan.": null, "Fey: Thanks.": null, "Chirp: Wonderful, well, it's been fantastic doing business with you.": null, "You're very small.": null, "Fey: I know.": null, "Chirp: Yes, but I love that.": null, "Fey: Thank you.

I love taller men.": null, "Chirp: They have such short lives that they just live so big.": null, "Fey: Thank you so much. You're so kind.

You actually get a little favor.": null, "[players oohing]": null, "Aabria hands Emily a glass trinket.": null, "Aabria: She goes,": null, "Fey: Thanks for the hookup!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she runs back across your sword and hops into the flower.": null, "Chirp: Okay.

Suntar is still\u2014": null, "Squak: Should I have gone after Apollo? I should, right? It's just,": null, "Renner's here.": null, "Chirp: I know, I know.": null, "Squak: Here, I'll go put eyes on Apollo.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, go put eyes, and whatever else you want.": null, "Brennan: All these fairies have so much shenanigans and espionage that": null, "there's just going to be an empty theater with Jeremy Renner onstage by": null, "himself.": null, "Surena: The show of his life.": null, "Aabria: You actually see, yeah, there's lots of people getting messages": null, "and receiving messages and moving places. Some people are just huffing": null, "the flower and then kind of laying back and being like, \"I like this": null, "more now, tight,\" as everyone gets up, and we're going to cut back to": null, "this moment as Major Hob arrives.": null, "BINX: We're going to give them a little bit of privacy, right?": null, "BINX: Because I have a thing.": null, "Andhera: You have your thing, and I have to make sure that the thing": null, "doesn't get out of hand.": null, "BINX: Yes, because it's so wild and messy.": null, "Andhera: It's wild and we're messy!": null, "BINX: Oh god, let's just run.": null, "Surena: Grab your hand and run.": null, "Major Hob: Well. [clears throat] Delloso de la Rue.": null, "Rue: Ah. I was wondering where your...": null, "Major Hob: I just received a missive from the Court of Sea Foam, our": null, "benevolent hosts here at this, perhaps the final, Bloom. I instructed": null, "some members of that court to align with some subordinates of mine in": null, "the goblin military to collect information from the detritus and refuse": null, "of the court's functioning during this Bloom. Long have I been searching": null, "for the agent saboteur within the inner workings of the Court of Wonder": null, "that destroyed the marriage of the Prince Apollo to the Viscountess": null, "Grabalba, and I have been wracking my brain\u2014": null, "Rue: I thought this was going to be a different conversation. [laughs]": null, "How silly of me. How absolutely silly of me. What was I thinking? What": null, "was I thinking? Major Hob, I would like to excuse myself from this": null, "conversation. I think I've had enough.": null, "Major Hob: I'm certain that you would like to excuse yourself, Delloso": null, "de la Rue. I have seen many cruelties in my time in Faerie, but none": null, "quite so cutting as to take a hapless, unsophisticated goblin and": null, "bamboozle his mind with... [stammering] distracting things such that the": null, "caper which he is attempting to solve eludes him. My court's honor was": null, "maligned. You are the one who maligned it, and I finally have to proof I": null, "needed that you were the one\u2014": null, "Rue: What did I do to malign the court?": null, "Major Hob: Our political future rested on the marriage of Grabalba to": null, "the Prince Apollo, and it was on its way to happening until the very": null, "final moment, when you\u2014": null, "Rue: I can't have this conversation with you, not now! Because now I": null, "understand where your priorities lie. BINX assured me that you\u2014hm. I": null, "thought you were different, I really did. I allowed myself to think you": null, "were a different person, but you're still the same goblin, thinking": null, "about your court before you. I was wrong, and I feel so foolish.": null, "Understand that everything I have done was for love.": null, "Major Hob: For love of your court? For love of your prince?": null, "Rue: For love. Do you know what that means? Do you think Apollo loved": null, "Grabalba? Do you think Grabalba loved Apollo? Sickening, the things": null, "people do for power. The things people do for honor. And for what?": null, "Ultimately, for what? I couldn't allow it to happen.": null, "Major Hob: So you admit it.": null, "Rue: Yes, I ended the marriage. It had to be done.": null, "Major Hob: So, you saw me tromping in, a roughshod, muddy-booted oaf,": null, "and you thought, I'll make this idiot feel that there is something here,": null, "that he might lose track and lose focus. You, more than anyone else, I": null, "thought would understand. All of these lords and ladies and nobles": null, "cavort around hither and yon. You understood service. You made sure that": null, "everyone else could feel something. That night at the masquerade ball, I": null, "was miserable, and you saw a figure that... That could've used a night": null, "of feeling that magic was real and that anything was possible. That was": null, "honor, wasn't it? That was service. I thought it service to the Bloom": null, "itself, but now I understand it was service to the Court of Wonder, to": null, "keep me off my balance.": null, "Rue: I love you. I love you intensely and fiercely. I love you in a way": null, "that I've never loved anything before in my life. I've professed all": null, "these things to you, and you did not reciprocate a response. You thought": null, "that was obligation? I did it because I cared for you. The moment we": null, "were together after the Hart Hunt, when you grabbed my wrist, I pulled": null, "away. I was not being myself. I was someone else. I pulled away because": null, "I didn't want you to know that I had claws, I had fur, that I was seven": null, "feet tall and not a slender, beautiful elf. I've shown myself because of": null, "you. I did it out of love for myself. In the last Blooms, I tried to be": null, "someone else because I thought that was the way the fey were going to": null, "accept me, and I met you, and I thought, no, I need to accept myself": null, "first.": null, "Aabria: In this heavy moment, I need both of you to make a Perception": null, "check.": null, "[Oscar titters]": null, "Brennan: Dirty 20.": null, "Oscar: 9.": null, "Aabria: You are in the middle of speaking, but you hear just a little": null, "dig in as Rue bares their soul to you, a scrape of a hoof against stone,": null, "and you see, off behind a pillar, the silhouette of Wuvvy standing by,": null, "watching and listening but not intervening. We're going to cut away from": null, "that really quickly, yeah, and move to Andhera and BINX.": null, "Surena: I think when I grabbed Andhera's hand, before, the first time I": null, "grabbed your hand, it was innocent friendship, right?
