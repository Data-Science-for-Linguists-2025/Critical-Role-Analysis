That's all that's happening here.": null, "Brennan: At the end of the episode, when we were having the kind of": null, "like, not conflict, but the little bit of like, okay, so you guys had": null, "this great vision. And I was doing my best not to be like, a stick in": null, "the mud.": null, "Brennan: Where it's like-": null, "Jasper: That was so good.": null, "Brennan: Okay, I don't have to freak out 'cause my daughter can read": null, "symbols like that. That's actually helpful. That's good. Like, it": null, "doesn't mean that we listen to the stoats that wrote this.": null, "Aabria: Right.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Brennan: But it's good that someone is magic and knows what it does.": null, "That's good. We don't have to freak out. We don't have to be like, \"You": null, "never show this gift to the world!\" You know, it's like, great, you can": null, "read. I love that. I support you. But when this conflict happened here,": null, "I was lining up a shot, and you swept my leg at the last second 'cause": null, "you were talking, talking, talking.": null, "Aabria: Nice!": null, "Brennan: And I was like, \"He hasn't mentioned his kids. He hasn't": null, "mentioned that he's gonna be a dad.\" And I was, I swear to God, Tula was": null, "gonna fucking\u2026 [mimics holding a sniper] (cast laughing) And I was like-": null, "Erika: Just try.": null, "Aabria: You were just waiting. You were like, I need clear.": null, "Brennan: And then you said, \"As someone who's going to be a father, I": null, "need to ensure that my children's life is safe,\" and that's what's": null, "motivating you.": null, "Erika: You're like, \"Goddamn it!\"": null, "Brennan: And it's like... 'Cause I swear to God I was gonna be like, you": null, "know, \"Geoffrey, Thorn,\" you know?": null, "Aabria: Oh!": null, "Jasper: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Brennan: You know, like, have that moment, right, that you go like, I": null, "see something happening that I've seen in the past. And it was just...": null, "Aabria: Oof, brutal.": null, "Jasper: Hm.": null, "Brennan: But it wasn't what I've seen in the past, and you did talk": null, "about the fact that Viola was with child. And like, you did all, you": null, "said all the right stuff and then immediately everyone was like... And": null, "then immediately the fact that Lila was like-": null, "Brennan: \"I think he's...\" 'Cause the fact that morning you were like,": null, "\"I think he's a bad man.\" And then you were like, \"I think he's right.\"": null, "And I was like... And then the one person that I was gonna look to and I": null, "was like, okay, people are starting to gang up. Sister, we gotta... And": null, "you were like...": null, "Aabria: (groans awkwardly) Nope! (laughs)": null, "Brennan: My husband died and-": null, "Aabria: You're just getting Heisman'd left and right like, \"No!\"": null, "Rashawn: We stood up to Mom. Like, that exchange I was just so": null, "embarrassed like, oh, you're talking to my mother this way. If I was": null, "there, I would-": null, "Izzy: Rashawn, in fact, actually looked sick. (cast laughing)": null, "Rashawn: Oh my God, he's saying that to my mom. What is he doing? Oh my": null, "God. She pays our rent. Like, what are you doing? (cast laughing) Like,": null, "what the fuck, dude?": null, "Jasper: She pays our rent!": null, "Erika: It's that vibe, right?": null, "Erika: But then of just being like, no, no.": null, "Jasper: No.": null, "Izzy: Sometimes when you're outside of the family you're like, this is": null, "actually just a person. (laughs)": null, "Jasper: Mm-hmm.": null, "Izzy: But when you're in a family it's like...": null, "Siobhan: No, you don't understand. She said a thing to me when I was six": null, "that ruined my life.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Rashawn: And I will believe it even if facts are put in front of me.": null, "Izzy: Of course.": null, "Jasper: Mm-hmm. And also, I think there's definitely something to the": null, "idea that like, sometimes these kind of ideas have to come outside of": null, "the family, do you know what I mean? Because they are such big, bold": null, "swings that like, you're never gonna take that from, do you know what I": null, "mean? 'Cause you're almost like blinded by your love for them and your": null, "need to protect them and so hearing such like, a foreign concept from": null, "one of them you're like, no, absolutely not. I have the power to shut": null, "this down immediately. Not happening.": null, "Brennan: I feel like there's also an element of like, like you're": null, "saying, the fact... One of the big sister dynamics of like, younger": null, "sister to older sister is you are still in a mom frame of reference.": null, "Like, even though you're an adult, you don't have children and so you're": null, "still the child of your mom.": null, "Brennan: And I think for me, like, even though the thing you were like,": null, "\"Mom's not snoring.\" Like, \"Can you hear she's not snoring?\" I'm like,": null, "\"Yeah, she heard everything.\" (cast laughing) And it's like, she heard": null, "it all and it's whatever.": null, "Izzy: Yeah, it's whatever.": null, "Brennan: It's like, oh, Mom's gonna be mad? My fucking husband's dead.": null, "Like, oh no, my mom's mad at me. Like, it's just all, there's such": null, "fresher wounds than my fucking mom shit.": null, "Brennan: And it's like, also unrelated, I was thinking, when we were": null, "talking about like, you, and you're like, \"I love you. I wanna be like": null, "you.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, but you're kinda like your dad who was an": null, "investigator arcana guy.\" And then I was talking about like, just the": null, "moment of like, \"I liked jumping off rocks when I was a kid.\" And I": null, "kinda thought about you two. And then earlier in the \"Adventuring Party\"": null, "you were like, \"You two are similar.\" And I was like, I think Dad,": null, "Kenji, was just Jaysohn. I think it was just...": null, "Brennan: I think he was an enormous barbarian stoat who was like, \"Look": null, "at what I can do!\" (cast laughing)": null, "Siobhan: Grandpa lifted up a big rock that's bigger than him. He's so": null, "strong.": null, "Erika: That's exactly correct.": null, "Brennan: Exactly correct.": null, "Erika: Exactly correct.": null, "Jasper: Grandpa's there lifting a rock. Check it out, check it out.": null, "Brennan: Check it out.": null, "Jasper: Check it out.": null, "Brennan: Look how fast I can spin it in a circle. (cast laughing)": null, "Jasper: Do you think I can catch my own tail? Just give me a second.": null, "Give me a second. Give me a second. I'll get it.": null, "Siobhan: He just saw you, immediately picked you up and you fell in love": null, "with him.": null, "Izzy: I believe the big boulder, lifting it up is how he died, which is": null, "why we never talk about it.": null, "Rashawn: Oh no!": null, "Izzy: It wasn't the Blue.": null, "Rashawn: Like those, you've seen, like, it's terrible to watch like,": null, "Olympic deadlifters.": null, "Siobhan: Oh, yeah.": null, "Erika: Oh God!": null, "Rashawn: Sorry to everyone.": null, "Erika: Oh God! (laughs)": null, "Rashawn: Yeah, with like the dude who... It was the Beijing Olymp- the": null, "Beijing. It was like (exhales sharply) we got it. And then arm pops-": null, "Jasper: No! (Erika screams) That's the worst thing that's happened.": null, "Rashawn: I'm so sorry.": null, "Aabria: Fun facts. I cannot snatch anymore, which is an Olympic lift,": null, "because I have dislocated my shoulder so much that it happens every time": null, "I do that.": null, "Siobhan: No!": null, "Aabria: So I've experienced that and it's un-cute, you're just like,": null, "\"Got it. Everything's terrible now.\"": null, "Jasper: You can't snatch, but you can still slay!": null, "Aabria: Thanks, yay! And now I tell D&D stories (players laughing)": null, "instead of lifting heavy weights over my head. Coulda been Kenji.": null, "Erika: You know, every season-": null, "Jasper: Coulda been Kenji.": null, "Erika: It's a thing like, ah, it's \"The Breakfast Club\" meets fantasy or": null, "candy, and this one's body horror meets \"Watership Down.\"": null, "Jasper: Yep.": null, "Aabria: What's wrong?": null, "Erika: I mean... (players laughing)": null, "Aabria: Hey, you accurately described a thing. Make your fucking point.": null, "(laughs)": null, "Erika: No, no, no, no.": null, "Jasper: Elaborate.": null, "Izzy: But also, just tap into \"Watership Down.\"": null, "Rashawn: \"Death at a Funeral\" or like, whatever. Like just a Christmas": null, "family movie of like, everything coming to...": null, "Rashawn: So like, the matriarch died or whatever and we have to figure": null, "out-": null, "Siobhan: Right, eat the fish, bitch! (cast laughing)": null, "Aabria: Well, it was really fun getting an opportunity to lean more into": null, "like, a thing I really like from \"Watership Down\" which was like, the": null, "sort of like, ability to have visions. And the moment where you're like,": null, "okay, I've gotta like, get you to where we're going or the DM screen": null, "doesn't make any fucking sense.": null, "Aabria: We gotta get there. So having people have different ways to": null, "access and like, realize that like, that light that you're all being": null, "drawn toward, it felt very cool to like, have visions for you, both of": null, "you at the top of the game that sort of gave you a little bit of a look": null, "into where you've been and where you could be and then having Jaysohn's": null, "astral self sort of being vaguely aware of that sun.": null, "Jasper: Mm-hmm, yeah.": null, "Aabria: Whenever he's in the flow.": null, "Brennan: I felt so, I was just very in character. I felt so bad 'cause I": null, "can't think of more of like, an improv curveball than pitching to Iz,": null, "like, describe writing in abstract as a stoat!": null, "Izzy: Oh my God.": null, "Siobhan: So good!": null, "Izzy: That was so hard.": null, "Siobhan: That was so smart.": null, "Brennan: You killed it.": null, "Siobhan: That was like, wow, I genuinely understand it. That's so good.": null, "Brennan: You explained it. You're like, literally it's like, \"Yeah, the": null, "shadow of Auntie Shrew that we know that that's her 'cause it's her": null, "shadow, these shapes are the shadows of other things in the world.\" And": null, "you go, yeah, that is what writing-": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Brennan: That's literally what writing is, like-": null, "Jasper: Yeah, yeah, that was lovely.": null, "Brennan: It was perfect.": null, "Brennan: It was sick as hell.": null, "Izzy: Give me a fucking history documentary.
