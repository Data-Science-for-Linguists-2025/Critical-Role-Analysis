The two things I'm waiting": null, "on for mission reasons are anything that the Sea Foam Court has": null, "delivered about the Court of Wonder, I will look into as soon as it": null, "arrives, and I've informed my salt goblins to alert me the moment that": null, "that happens.": null, "Brennan: And on top of that, I want to be available and let the Lord": null, "Blemish and Lady Boil know that if they want any further information": null, "about what I observed about the Lady Gwyndolin, I am happy to make that": null, "report more in full when I am not walking on my way to an imminent duel.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Lord Blemish is actually the one that's writing the note": null, "and is kind of deep in their letters as he's going and sending them off": null, "with groups of salt goblins to respond to correspondences, and Lady Boil": null, "will kind of sidle up to you and pats the ground for you to sit beside": null, "her.": null, "[Brennan makes a thumping sound]": null, "[gentle folk music]": null, "Aabria: She whistles and wakes up a couple of sleeping hobgoblins, tells": null, "them to come over, and she sits on top of them so she can look at you": null, "eye to eye.": null, "Captain Hob: What I would say that I was unable to say more plainly": null, "yesterday, before the duel, in waiting and hiding during the hunt of the": null, "wild hart, I beheld through the fog that parted in the absence of the": null, "Lords of the Wing and Prince Andhera of the Unseelie a departure of one": null, "young Miss Gwyndolin Thistle-spring.": null, "Lady Boil: Thistle-hop, but keep going.": null, "Captain Hob: Oh, sorry, different, different. One young Miss Gwyndolin": null, "Thistle-hop of the Court of Wonder.": null, "Lady Boil: They say she's an assassin.": null, "Captain Hob: And I believe they may be right. I beheld her disguised": null, "self pass where my eyes could see through the thick of the forest, but": null, "my\u2014": null, "Brennan:\u00a0[mimicking ear movements] Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.": null, "Captain Hob: \u2014ears could not be so easily manipulated by her trickery.": null, "She spoke in a different voice. Not only a different voice, but a": null, "different manner altogether. She seemed brusque, somehow prepossessed of": null, "some urgency in her communique with whomever had joined her there in the": null, "forest, either in person or through means magical in nature.": null, "Lady Boil: Hm. Okay.": null, "Captain Hob: And then I slunk backwards through the trees.": null, "Lady Boil: Okay, okay. I'm processing now, but thank you.": null, "Captain Hob: I can climb backwards.": null, "Lady Boil: I think we are at a point, my dear Captain, to intervene and": null, "get some straight answers from her.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well. There may be an opportunity at today's tea": null, "party. If I see an opportunity, do you wish for me to collect yourself": null, "and Lord Blemish or to take matters into my own hands?": null, "Lady Boil: I would love for you to take matters into your own hands.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well.": null, "Lady Boil: Remember who you are.": null, "Captain Hob: Captain K.P.\u2014ooh, you mean in a bigger sort of sense. Yes.": null, "I will do this.": null, "Lady Boil: Remember, we are\u2026 what's the word? Because I know it's not": null, "trash and squirrel goo. We're the carrot. Carrot.": null, "Captain Hob: Hm!": null, "Lady Boil: You're the stick.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well. There are some points of intelligence that I may": null, "be collecting in the very near future from our friends in the Court of": null, "Sea Foam. Hopefully these will aid in my interrogation, by which I mean": null, "gentle conversation with young Miss Thistle-hop.": null, "Lady Boil: While I have you here, I do have to ask, what is your": null, "relationship with the Court of Wonder and Rue? We were all there, but": null, "she never said why we were all there.": null, "Captain Hob: As you may be well aware, your ladyship, I saw an": null, "opportunity to strike, and I took it. Insinuating that the duel was due": null, "to the dishonor felt by Delloso de la Rue at a rejected marriage": null, "proposal by the Viscountess Grabalba, thus to place the Court of Wonder": null, "at a disadvantageous position. The truth, my lady, that I tell to you": null, "now in all honesty, [quietly] I've got no idea what the duel was about,": null, "I really don't. I have no clue. I straight-up have no clue.": null, "Lady Boil: What? What do you mean?": null, "Captain Hob: Well, there was a moment in the woods that I shared with": null, "Rue where I invited them to come into a hiding space with me, and they": null, "declined, and I worried that I had hurt their feelings, and they left": null, "abruptly, and they commanded me to continue in the hunt, and as the": null, "Master of Ceremonies, I dared not deny their request. And the following": null, "morning, I had apparently... My understanding, based on context alone,": null, "is that an attempt at kindness and civility from me was so odious to": null, "Delloso de la Rue that it moved them to tears, and rather than having": null, "the courage to explain to me why my affections would be so onerous, I": null, "suppose I was so far beneath them that they saw fit that their assistant": null, "would be enough to reclaim their lost honor.": null, "Emily: Oof.": null, "Oscar: Oh shit!": null, "Lady Boil: My dear, sick, twisted little Hob.": null, "Aabria: And she pats your cheek.": null, "Lady Boil: They'll never understand. It's what they do. They twist": null, "intentions, and I'm so sorry that they did that to you, but I hope you": null, "remember this. Remember this slight, remember the choice that they made,": null, "that their court always makes. You are best as a blunt instrument, and": null, "ought not to get caught up in the machinations of people who know only": null, "how to speak.": null, "Captain Hob: You're quite right, your ladyship. I will endeavor to": null, "remember this, as I do all of the wise words you have deemed fit to": null, "share with your humble servant in myself. I am to have a short sparring": null, "match before teatime with the Prince Andhera of the Unseelie Court.": null, "There will be a period of time where I have his ear. I would ask you,": null, "Lady Boil, are the intentions of the Goblin Court herein limited to": null, "recovering our lost honor from the alleged engagement between our court": null, "and the Court of Wonder, or, if I should talk to the young prince of the": null, "Unseelie and find him amenable to a dalliance with the viscountess of": null, "our own court, would that be untoward of me to suggest in the pique of": null, "our brotherly thrustings with various weaponry?": null, "Lady Boil: Hm.": null, "Aabria: And she gets lost in thought for a little bit. Can you make an": null, "Insight check for me?": null, "Brennan: Sure, I can do that. Not great, that's only an 8.": null, "Aabria: Even with an 8, there was something in the way she spoke to you": null, "about the Court of Wonder and Rue that felt like a little bit of a": null, "reach, and even you noticed that. And now that you've sort of": null, "supplicated her for advice on this, you see her grow more comfortable": null, "and more confident.": null, "Lady Boil: How about this? I'll sit in and watch you spar. Have whatever": null, "conversation you need, and if you get lost with words as you are wont to": null, "do, my good soldier, I'll be happy to step in and progress things.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well, Lady Boil. Of course.": null, "Lady Boil: Good lad.": null, "Aabria: And she crawls down off of the hobgoblin and goes back to Lord": null, "Blemish, and they continue to confer amongst one another. Every now and": null, "then, you catch them looking up and over at you.": null, "Brennan: I'll go over to the sparring field and I'll take my military": null, "coat off.": null, "Aabria: You're just full nakey?": null, "Brennan: No, now I put on pants.": null, "Aabria: Always one.": null, "Brennan: Sparring pants! Yep! I'm only naked if one of the halves is": null, "uncovered.": null, "Surena: It's cartoon laws.": null, "Brennan: Cartoon laws, yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Love that, love that.": null, "Oscar: You're either a Donald Duck or a Mickey Mouse.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Hey!": null, "Brennan: There you go, exactly.": null, "Omar: Nude animals are rude animals.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Andhera, do you head straight over? Is there any reason": null, "to delay?": null, "Omar: No, I head straight over.": null, "Aabria: Then you reach a little sparring field.": null, "[curious instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: It's a cleared bit of grass that, even despite the grown-over,": null, "hyper-verdant greenery, even despite the grown over, hyper verdant": null, "greenery, is a bit downtrodden and yellowing and patchy, just because": null, "this is also the goblin pee pee field.": null, "Omar: Mm.": null, "Surena: Oh yeah, that's right.": null, "Omar: Great, I very trepidatiously step over a lot of the pee pees that": null, "are growing there, and wave from afar.": null, "Captain Hob: Your majesty! What-ho!": null, "Andhera: My fair Captain. I hope you don't mind, I brought my strange": null, "dog.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0": null, "Captain Hob: [chortles] I think your faithful hound shall fit in quite": null, "well. Many of our goblins also have grandpa face.": null, "Andhera: [laughs] Well, that's rather perfect, I suppose. Go\u2014hey, look": null, "at me. [finger-snapping] Look, look, look at me. No\u2014eyes, but look at": null, "me. Look at... Look at me. Go have fun. Go have fun. Go.": null, "Aabria: He lays down.": null, "Andhera: Okay, great. Captain, good morning. Good morning. It's good to": null, "see you.": null, "Captain Hob: Good morning to you. You look rested and well today.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to toss a wooden quarterstaff, quite long, I'll": null, "toss it over to you. [mimics wind whipping] Spin one around me.": null, "Captain Hob: I must say, you are a prodigious talent, the way you": null, "executed that maneuver, so deft in the dueling lane there.": null, "Andhera: [laughs] You're making me blush. If I may be candid...": null, "Captain Hob: Mm.": null, "Andhera: I was completely scared shitless, because last time we fought,": null, "you knocked me off my steed, my Nightmare, and nearly killed me.": null, "Captain Hob: Oh. Um\u2026 [hesitant] Ha ha.": null, "Andhera: Which was good. It was battle.": null, "Captain Hob: Yes.": null, "Andhera: Yeah.": null, "Captain Hob: Forgive me for taking an avuncular role. You are yourself a": null, "prince, and I am sure if you had some older brothers or uncles or those": null, "around\u2014": null, "Brennan leans closer.": null, "Captain Hob: You don't have to talk about one of your most shameful": null, "moments of your life right as we get started with a sort of fun... You": null, "can rib me if you want. You could say, ha! You don't have to sort of": null, "share your failures so aloud in front of everyone.": null, "Andhera: I see. In fact, I take it back. Instead, I will share one of my": null, "greatest achievements. One time, I folded 100 paper bats.": null, "Captain Hob: Sorry, bags?": null, "Andhera: Oh, if only. Those are tough, because you have to get the sides": null, "as well. No, bats. Bats.": null, "Captain Hob: You folded 100 paper bats.": null, "Andhera: Yes. Well, they weren't bats before, [laughs] but once I folded": null, "them, they became bats, so.": null, "Captain Hob: Right, well, the quarterstaff is a remarkable weapon.": null, "Aabria: We will wrap from there.": null, "Aabria: Talk to me, Gwyn. What are you doing this fine morning?": null, "Surena: Well, Gwyndolin, in understanding that yesterday she had a bad": null, "day as far as talking to people about stuff, so in lieu of being more of": null, "the Court of Wonder, more wonderful, I am deciding to wear a large hat,": null, "a very fancy hat, and getting as gussied up as someone who has only been": null, "around the Court of Wonder for a short amount of time, so it's not as": null, "glorious as Rue, but she's trying. She's doing the thing. She has a": null, "train and a cape.": null, "Oscar: [laughing]\u00a0A train and a cape?": null, "Surena: Yes.": null, "Oscar: That's a lot of draggage.": null, "Chirp: Gwyndolin is positively dragging mud!": null, "Surena: Has a large hat that has a bird-like stuffed animal that she has": null, "crocheted to the top.": null, "Chirp: It's like everything shouldn't be working, and yet it does!": null, "Squak: That crow is not anatomically correct at all.": null, "Chirp: No, one wing is way bigger than the other.": null, "Surena: She gracefully enters the\u2014wherever she, like, where the": null, "breakfast is, right? Because if it's a big event, there's probably": null, "communal brunch-y things.": null, "Emily: Yeah, we're at a Marriott, right?": null, "[Emily and Surena laugh]": null, "Aabria: Yes, yes.": null, "Surena: That's what I thought you might find. I see myself in a hotel": null, "room.": null, "Aabria: One of the ones with a kitchen.\u00a0It's a Residence Inn.": null, "Lou: They got a toaster there.": null, "Aabria: You could fuck around a little bit in there.": null, "[inquisitive instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: Yes, as you head to one of these little gatherings for brunch,": null, "you see that there are actually several members of the Sea Foam Court,": null, "sort of late risers hanging about and talking, and they look up and over": null, "at you.": null, "Surena: I curtsy.": null, "Aabria: Make a Persuasion check for me.": null, "Surena: That's a nat 20.": null, "[all cheering]": null, "Surena: These dice are magic.": null, "Emily: Put it out on the new moon for you.": null, "Aabria: And you see a look cross their faces of just acknowledgement and": null, "then dismissal and then some conference, and then they look at you": null, "again, and you see them considering you, and then a sort of small smile": null, "erupts from one of their lips.": null, "Sea Foam Court Member: Why don't you come and join us?": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh. I would love to.": null, "Sea Foam Court Member: Yes, come.": null, "Surena: Kind of scoot on in.": null, "Sea Foam Court Member: You can go... You know, we'll have some food": null, "brought for you. Don't worry about it.": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh, yes, I was going to eat. So, thank you so much for": null, "inviting me over. You are throwing, honestly, such a beautiful event.": null, "Sea Foam Court Member: Thank you for saying that. You know, there are": null, "some here who believe that the Court of Wonder is taking a": null, "disproportionate amount of credit for this Bloom.": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh, that's terrible. I mean, we're at your home. You should": null, "be having all of the credit. In fact, you can have mine. If anyone": null, "thinks that I have anything to do with the wonderfulness that is this": null, "event, then I'll absolutely tell them it was you. What is your name?": null, "Sea Foam Court Member: You are so sweet. I am Ephendra.": null, "Gwyndolin: Ephendra.": null, "Ephendra: Yes.": null, "Gwyndolin: Gwyndolin.": null, "Ephendra: So lovely to meet you. This is Alven and Kiri. We can speak": null, "plainly, though.": null, "Gwyndolin: Okay.": null, "Ephendra: We hear things and know things, and know that you're not": null, "necessarily on the up and up with people or your court or whatever.": null, "We're not judging. We like you.": null, "Gwyndolin: Well, you know, our court is so big, you know?": null, "Ephendra: Mm-hm.": null, "Gwyndolin: And I'm sure that with a court of your size as well, there": null, "are differing opinions about things that are important, and that's what": null, "makes good decisions. If we all had the same thoughts and the same": null, "opinions, then we would never get anywhere, would we?": null, "Ephendra: You. You're not like the other ones. Huh. There's one more": null, "coming, if you want to stay and hang out. We have a treasured guest.": null, "[whispering] There's a human.": null, "Gwyndolin: [whispering] There's a human? I love humans! I mean, they're": null, "fine. I mean, I'm actually really excited, if I'm gonna be honest.": null, "Ephendra: Right? Oh my goodness.": null, "Gwyndolin: So, do you see a lot of humans?": null, "Ephendra: No, she was just sort of presented to us, and we've been": null, "showing her a lovely time. Oh, there she is. Wannessa, come over.": null, "Aabria: And you see this study in human averages\u2014": null, "Oscar: Not what I thought you were gonna say.": null, "Omar: Call me out over here.": null, "Aabria: No, she's got just sort of a medium tan skin, mousy, brown hair": null, "that's a little curled and pulled back, like, it's well done, but just": null, "pulled back into a ponytail. She's like 5'7\" and her face is plain but": null, "symmetrical, and she comes over\u2014": null, "Emily: [laughs] Plain but symmetrical? Scathing, I love it.": null, "Aabria: Damned by faint praise. Like, in comparison to any fey ever, how": null, "does a normal face do anything? And she walks over to you and looks at": null, "you and kind of takes you in, too, and gives a deep curtsy, well": null, "executed, well balanced, and you can see that her head is just sort of": null, "on a swivel as she looks around with wide eyes, just fully dazzled by": null, "everything she sees and everyone she meets.": null, "Human: It's a pleasure to meet you. Hi.": null, "Gwyndolin: Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you as well. What was your name?": null, "Wannessa: Wannessa.": null, "Gwyndolin: Wannessa, that's right. So, Wannessa, how are you... How are": null, "you adjusting? Welcome.": null, "Wannessa: Thank you. I'm good. Everything's just so grand. It really is": null, "breathtaking. You are lovely. Wow.": null, "Gwyndolin: You are so weird.": null, "[Brennan laughing]": null, "Gwyndolin: And I like it\u2014no, it's a compliment! I really enjoy it!": null, "Wannessa: How am I weird? I don't\u2014": null, "Gwyndolin: Well, you have, like, these hands, but I feel like you should": null, "have more thumbs, because the thumb is the most useful finger on a hand,": null, "and you only have one, and you can't get more thumbs, you know?": null, "Wannessa: [sniffling] Yeah, you're right, I... How many thumbs do you": null, "have?": null, "Gwyndolin: I can have as many as I want. Right now I have one, but I": null, "could have three. I just want one right now.": null, "Wannessa: Oh. That is magical.": null, "Gwyndolin: It is, it's very magical.": null, "Wannessa: I have so much to learn about everything here.": null, "Gwyndolin: Uh-huh.": null, "Wannessa: I... What is it that you do? I've only really met people from": null, "this court, but I see so many other fey. But everyone here has been": null, "telling me to be careful, because fey from other courts are dangerous": null, "and they'll eat a human as soon as look at them.": null, "Gwyndolin: That is true. But I\u2014": null, "Wannessa: [aghast] It is?": null, "Gwyndolin: I mean, not everyone. You're safe. You're fine. Listen, I'm": null, "gonna watch out for you. You're gonna be fine, and you have such honored": null, "guests guarding you. You're perfectly safe.": null, "Wannessa: Thank you.": null, "Aabria: And she immediately reaches out and grabs your hands.": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh!": null, "Wannessa: It's so nice to have a friend here.": null, "Gwyndolin: It's incredible to meet you, Wannessa, and I do hope you": null, "enjoy the Bloom, and what do humans eat? You eat stuff.": null, "Wannessa: I mean, like\u2014": null, "Gwyndolin: No, I know what you eat. You like bacon. That's a thing you": null, "like.": null, "Wannessa: Do you not?": null, "Gwyndolin: No, I do, but I know that you love it. Or a muffin. Would you": null, "like a muffin?": null, "Wannessa: [whispering] Are there muffins here?": null, "Gwyndolin: Yes.": null, "Wannessa: [voice breaking]\u00a0I get so nervous, because I know that there's": null, "so many rules about what I can and can't eat, and then I came, and I'm": null, "running out of trail mix. I've been here for weeks.": null, "[Brennan and Emily laugh]": null, "Wannessa: I'm so hungry.": null, "Gwyndolin: Have you only been eating trail mix?": null, "Wannessa: I brought a lot. [sniffles]": null, "Gwyndolin: Well, Ephendra?": null, "Ephendra: Yes?": null, "Gwyndolin: Can we get a large tray of chocolate chip muffins? Is that a": null, "thing\u2014": null, "Ephendra: For the human.": null, "Gwyndolin: For the human, and I\u2014": null, "Ephendra: Because they have to eat? How often do they eat?": null, "Gwyndolin: I think they eat every three to four hours, and they have to": null, "be watered, as well.": null, "Ephendra: What?": null, "Gwyndolin: They stay hydra\u2014they're mostly water.": null, "Ephendra: [scoffs] That\u2019s\u2014look, we're from this court, and I still find": null, "that disgusting.": null, "Gwyndolin: Honestly, Ephendra, if you need help with Wannessa at all,": null, "let me know, and\u2014": null, "Ephendra: Would you like to take her for the day? She's delightful, but": null, "cries frequently.": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh, that is a sign of sadness, yes.": null, "Ephendra: Thank you so much.": null, "Aabria makes a shoving motion.": null, "Oscar: Whoa.": null, "Aabria: And you actually see that a little ribbon is put into your hand.": null, "Surena: Okay.": null, "Aabria: It's not tied to anything, it's just a little blueish purple": null, "ribbon tied in a very ornate bow.": null, "Ephendra: Just return her at the end of the day, whenever you're done.": null, "Thank you so much, you're so sweet. What was your name? Gwyn.": null, "Gwyndolin: Gwyndolin, yeah. You can call me Gwyn.": null, "Ephendra: Mm-hm, thank you. We're gonna\u2014we got to go.": null, "Aabria: And they quickly get up and evacuate, and it's just sort of you": null, "and Wannessa sitting there, and you see it's actually Alven that kind of": null, "leans over and flags a server and points in your direction, and just a": null, "little sort of catfish reverse mermaid-looking server looks over at you": null, "from far away, and is just sort of waiting for a signal.": null, "Oscar: Reverse mermaid?": null, "Server: [mouthing] All the way over?": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh, do you want me to come to you?": null, "Server: No. Okay.": null, "Gwyndolin: I don't know what you want from me.": null, "Aabria: Walks over.": null, "[regal music]": null, "Server: Sorry, mostly people will just sort of, they flag what they want": null, "and I just kind of do my best to read lips and bring it.": null, "Gwyndolin: Oh,\u00a0I'm so sorry.": null, "Server: That's okay.": null, "Gwyndolin: I would like a dozen of chocolate chip muffins. I can help": null, "you bake them, if you'd like. Would, I mean, that\u2014": null, "Server: No, we're good at baking.": null, "Gwyndolin: You are incredibly good at baking. and\u2014": null, "Server: Well, not me personally, I just bring muffins.": null, "Gwyndolin: Yes, and I would never overstep, because I don't do that,": null, "because I'm wonderful. Anyway.": null, "Server: Mm-hm. Oh, wonderful, because you're from\u2014": null, "Gwyndolin: Yes, mm-hm, I am.": null, "Server: That's very good and funny.": null, "Gwyndolin: I'm rich. Anyway. Mm-hm?": null, "Server: Muffins.": null, "Gwyndolin: Yes please, thank you.": null, "Server: Okay, all right.": null, "Aabria: And then they come back in 10 minutes with a bunch of sort of": null, "not freshly baked, but sort of freshly warmed-up chocolate chip muffins.": null, "Brennan: Ooh!": null, "Aabria: And get placed in front of both you and Wannessa.": null, "Gwyndolin: So, Wannessa.": null, "Wannessa: Mm.": null, "Gwyndolin: You can eat those. They are safe, and not poisonous, because": null, "we would never do that.": null, "Wannessa: When you\u2026 [quietly] I'm so hungry. [gobbling]": null, "Aabria: She dives on and starts devouring them.": null, "Gwyndolin: Ephendra said you've been upset. Leaking water, fluid from": null, "your eyes.": null, "Wannessa: [mouth full] We call it crying.": null, "Gwyndolin: Yes, that is the word.": null, "Wannessa: Mm-hm.": null, "Gwyndolin: I know. Are you okay? Were you, is this... How are you here?": null, "Wannessa: Hm?": null, "Gwyndolin: Hm?": null, "Wannessa: [exhales] Uh...": null, "Gwyndolin: If you don't know, it's okay.": null, "Wannessa: I don't want to talk about it right now.": null, "Gwyndolin: It's okay. We're new friends. You don't have to tell me": null, "everything.": null, "Wannessa: Really?": null, "Gwyndolin: Yeah, of course. You can only tell me what you feel": null, "comfortable telling me. Why would I make you say anything that you don't": null, "want to say? That's ridiculous.": null, "Aabria: She sort of regards you, confused and worried that this is some": null, "sort of trick.": null, "Gwyndolin: Mm-hm.": null, "Wannessa: Okay.": null, "Gwyndolin: Well, you're hanging out with me today.": null, "Wannessa: I'm just gonna eat my muffins.": null, "Gwyndolin: Okay. Enjoy. I'll eat a muffin as well. This is a really good": null, "day.": null, "Aabria: And we kind of move on from there. Rue, what are you doing?": null, "Oscar: I'm still in my quarters.": null, "Oscar: Wearing my bedtime sort of regalia, a gossamer ring, shining": null, "rainbow moment.": null, "Aabria: Yes, a moment.": null, "Oscar: And to be honest, I know there's duties I have to do and I have": null, "to be out and about, but I'm not doing them.": null, "[thoughtful piano music]": null, "Oscar: Yesterday was a huge blow. It just shook Rue to their very core,": null, "and usually their sort of bedchamber is lit by candles. It has a very": null, "sort of calming presence, but Rue is sitting at the edge of their bed in": null, "darkness, contemplating even to step outside. They're thinking about the": null, "duel that happened, they're thinking about the choice that they made,": null, "the look that Hob gave them, the hurt of the Lords of the Wing, all of": null, "that stuff was\u2014I mean, they didn't sleep. It was so intense. But they": null, "have a job to do, and they are going to do it. So. within seconds, they": null, "step outside, and\u2014okay, so, this is the moment, this is the\u2014": null, "Oscar: So it is a sort of nod to Marie Antoinette.": null, "Aabria: [laughs] Yes, of course.": null, "Oscar: The wig, the powdered-up wig.": null, "Oscar: It starts off with hair, but then it sort of ends up with a stack": null, "of teacups on top of each other.": null, "Oscar: Sort of stacked up, and then when they walk, the teacups also": null, "sort of teeter-totter.": null, "Aabria: Oh, it's cute.": null, "Oscar: As you pan down, you see their face is giving you Marie": null, "Antoinette, powdered white moment.": null, "Aabria: Yeah yeah yeah.": null, "Oscar: Then they're wearing a massive ball gown in the style of the": null, "French Revolution, except that the outfit is made out of actual teacups,": null, "so there's a corseted moment that's just little bits of teacups sort of": null, "acting as a bustier moment.": null, "Aabria: Oh, we love it.": null, "Oscar: And then the bottom, the dress part of the gown, is a giant glass": null, "teacup, the dress part of the gown, is a giant glass teacup, as they": null, "glide around.": null, "Aabria: Incredible.": null, "Emily: I think Rue should get new art every time they change.": null, "Aabria: Every time.": null, "Emily: I will sacrifice my character portrait for another\u2014": null, "Aabria: No NPCs, only Rue fits.": null, "Brennan: Somewhere off in the world, David Kerns just went... [grunts]": null, "Aabria: As you are getting ready\u2014this is an outfit that requires some": null, "effort to get into\u2014your checklist for today's event is sort of spread": null, "out in front of you on some very fine parchment, and you see that just": null, "throughout the morning, even when you were in darkness, every now and": null, "then, a check gets marked, as Wuvvy, who has not seen or spoken to you": null, "since the duel, is running around trying to take care of everything, and": null, "the last thing you see as the final check is marked off and everything": null, "is prepared\u2014not that she's trying to take your job, but you laid the": null, "foundation and she's simply following through. You see in a cursive": null, "script, her handwriting, that just says, \u201cI hope I see you.\u201d": null, "Oscar: Hm. I've been sort of dreading this, because I have been avoiding": null, "Wuvvy, as well. I think in order for me to continue about my day, I will": null, "summon Wuvvy now.": null, "Aabria: Oh.": null, "Oscar: To get it out of the way.": null, "Aabria: What do you do?": null, "Rue: Wuvvy!": null, "Aabria: And it takes just a half a second longer than it normally does.": null, "Oscar: That's unsettling. I'm unsettled.": null, "Aabria: You know she hesitated just a second, and had to process her own": null, "emotions before showing up.": null, "Wuvvy: [fragile] Hi.": null, "Aabria: And she looks like herself again, a small satyr with curly hair": null, "and big eyes. Eyes that are shining just a little bit. She's holding": null, "back some unspoken emotion.": null, "Rue: I read today's list of things that must be done, and I must commend": null, "you for doing a great job, as you always do, Wuvvy. I also noticed the": null, "handwritten note at the end of the list saying that you would like to": null, "see me.": null, "Wuvvy: I didn't mean that in an ordering way. I just\u2014it was just a hope.": null, "But I understand if you\u2014": null, "Rue: No, no, I... I apologize, I've also been\u2026 [sighs]": null, "[solemn piano music]": null, "Rue: \u2026avoiding this moment, but I realize it must be done, not just for": null, "the sake of the Bloom turning out exactly the way that the Sea Foam": null, "Court orders it to be, but also, well, because I feel like something is": null, "different between us. And it makes me sad. I have so many questions to": null, "ask you, and I don't even know where to start.": null, "Wuvvy: I would hold nothing back from you.": null, "Rue: Why did you do it?": null, "Wuvvy: You wrote such a beautiful letter, and you were so open in that": null, "moment, and you didn't trust yourself to send it, and you didn't trust": null, "me, and anyone or anything that could make you doubt yourself like": null, "that... I'm sorry.": null, "Rue: I can't. I can't. I have organized the Bloom for millennia. I don't": null, "have time for my heart to be the center of anything. Do you not": null, "understand that my job is to make other people happy? I come last,": null, "always. I always have, and I always will. That is my job as a Bloom": null, "master. I understand that you want the very best for me, I really do,": null, "but I'm afraid that if I confess my feelings to Hob, the Bloom will fall": null, "apart, and if what they say is true, this is the last Bloom. How can we": null, "end it this way? How can I think of myself before anyone else for the": null, "first time?": null, "Wuvvy: What do you have to lose?": null, "Rue: Everything, Wuvvy. Everything.": null, "Wuvvy: No. You have everything to gain.": null, "Rue: How so?": null, "Wuvvy: If this is the last one, you've already put all the plans in": null, "place. It's gonna be incredible, and if the Bloom stops, then": null, "something's deeply wrong with fairy, with the Fey Realms, and no one": null, "will think about this kind of celebration again, and maybe that means": null, "war, and you know what that means for him. So if it's all going to end": null, "here, it might as well go off with a bang, right?": null, "Rue: I'm so scared.": null, "Wuvvy: Is it okay if I hug you?": null, "Rue: [softly] I would like that very much.": null, "Aabria: And she steps forward and takes on her feral form just to be a": null, "bit bigger so she can kind of wrap you up, and you can kind of feel the": null, "little bit of tears running down the fur of her muzzle as it gets a": null, "little longer and falling into that very edge of your very tall,": null, "beautiful hair.": null, "Wuvvy: You can't be afraid. In my time as a champion, fear is the thing.": null, "That's when it all falls apart. If it doesn't work out, who cares?": null, "You're still yourself, and we're still here, and I will never leave you.": null, "And if he breaks your heart, I'll break his neck.": null, "Rue: Don't.": null, "Wuvvy: I would.": null, "Rue: Please don't.": null, "Wuvvy: Yeah, I know.": null, "Rue: Don't do it.": null, "Wuvvy: Look, I'm gonna say no, but I would\u2014": null, "Rue: I like him, don't break his neck.": null, "Wuvvy: Yeah, I'm just saying\u2014": null, "Rue: Please don't break his neck.": null, "Wuvvy: I only got one good hit in.": null, "Rue: I don't want you to break his neck.": null, "Wuvvy: I would fucking kill him.": null, "Rue: It won't be pretty. It would be hard to do.": null, "Wuvvy: Says you.": null, "Rue: Have you seen his neck?": null, "Wuvvy: Excuse me?": null, "Rue: It's thick.": null, "Wuvvy: This isn't about me in this moment, and that's okay.": null, "Rue: Everything I've done is through fear. I shall arrive to the tea": null, "ceremony as my authentic self. It scares me to do, but if what you say": null, "is true, that this is the last Bloom and that we must do things and not": null, "regret them, then I need to do that exact thing at this moment. But": null, "you'll stay by my side, despite what they say, despite how they feel and": null, "the names that they will call me, you'll still be by my side.": null, "Wuvvy: I will never leave you.": null, "Rue: Thank you, Wuvvy.": null, "Wuvvy: You know I love you, right?": null, "Rue: I love you, too.": null, "Aabria: She just gives you one more big squeeze, and separates.": null, "Rue: Well, then. Let us be off.": null, "Wuvvy: Okay.": null, "Aabria: She offers her arm.": null, "Oscar: And I gladly take it.": null, "Aabria: And you head down towards the tea ceremony. [slams table] Okay,": null, "cousins, what the fuck is up? What're you doing? How you living?": null, "Emily: Uh, good, yeah.": null, "Emily:\u00a0I was like, is this an NPC that we\u2014": null, "Aabria: Nope, no, I'm just changing the energy because I'm literally": null, "crying a little bit.": null, "Lou: Oh, I don't want to approach her separately, I think I'm going to": null, "find her at the tea ceremony down the road, I think. If that is coming": null, "up soon, I think any plans or things, anyone I need to talk to, I'll do": null, "so in public.": null, "Lou: Personally I think that the word \u201cmatured\u201d is being associated with": null, "my name has probably gotten back to me, and I'm having a rather": null, "delightful morning reveling in my new position and status, or just the": null, "fact that things are, at least on one side, going according to plan.": null, "[peaceful instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: Then we're just going to move forward and reconvene as everyone": null, "moves down from the city, exits the front gates of the tidal island,": null, "moves across that narrow strip of overgrown, verdant land that takes you": null, "back to the shoreline that is the proper court of those who associate": null, "with sea foam, and across the beach, there are scores and scores of": null, "beautiful little tables, each with precious, delicate porcelain teapots": null, "in high service of cakes and cookies. Fey are mixing and walking and": null, "stopping by and saying hello to friends.": null, "Dome changes to a beach landscape.": null, "Surena: Nice.": null, "Lou: Mm-hm.": null, "Aabria: And enjoying the sunshine. You actually see, out in the shallow": null, "surf itself, there are fey riding hippocampi. Campuses?": null, "Emily: Like the little horse dolphins?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, they're like little horse dolphins that are sort of": null, "frolicking in the waves and then galloping up onshore and then bouncing": null, "back into the water, and people are taking little rides out together for": null, "up to a mile and then coming back.": null, "Brennan: As we approach, I'd like to turn to Andhera and go,": null, "Captain Hob: Oh, by the way, your majesty, I am possessed, I am afraid,": null, "of dueling obligations, no pun intended.": null, "[Andhera chuckles]": null, "Captain Hob: I owe the pleasure of my chaperoneship to, of course, the": null, "goblin viscountess Grabalba, daughter of the Goblin King, but I am": null, "afraid I have foolishly also seen myself partnered with Lord Airavis,": null, "the Earl of Peckersberg, for a croquet match. I don't suppose you'll be": null, "in want of taking my place just to escort the viscountess throughout the": null, "tea party? I would consider it an honest favor.": null, "Andhera: A favor to you is a favor that I would like to do. I didn't": null, "want it to rhyme, and then it did, and\u2014": null, "Captain Hob: Rhyming is actually good. It's good to rhyme.": null, "Andhera: I was afraid you would do one, and then you didn't.": null, "Captain Hob: No, no, I was just speaking.": null, "Andhera: Yes, I would be happy to.": null, "Captain Hob: Ah, an honor. Thank you very much for escorting the": null, "viscountess, your majesty.": null, "Andhera: Absolutely. Before you go and join Lord Squak...": null, "Lou: Lord Squak?": null, "Andhera: Airavis.": null, "Omar: I hear that on the wind.": null, "Surena: A bird whispers in your ear.": null, "Lou: He called me what?": null, "Omar: Many spies.": null, "Andhera: Yesterday, am I mistaken in saying that you were injured and": null, "poisoned, perhaps?": null, "Captain Hob: Yes, I believe that Wuvvy's blades may have been coated in": null, "some form of venom, but... Oh, sorry.": null, "Andhera: Well, if you don't mind, it would be my honor to cast Lesser": null, "Restoration on you.": null, "Captain Hob: Very kind. I would be more than happy for you to.

Oh, is this, sorry, [quietly] is this for appearances?": null, "Do you want to be seen healing me?": null, "Andhera: Absolutely not, I would not, and in fact, we would do it in": null, "privacy. I wouldn't want people to witness any sort of exterior duel,": null, "after duel situations. No no no, instead I simply want to offer to you": null, "an offer without expiration. If you're ever to need healing from poison,": null, "let me know, whether that happens to be from a fight, on the": null, "battlefield, or of a personal nature, it would be wonderful to just talk": null, "sometimes.": null, "[playful instrumental music]": null, "Brennan: I'm going to hold your eye contact for a moment and say,": null, "Captain Hob: Your majesty, in the halls of the fey, many doors remain": null, "closed.

Don't tell me what to do.": null, "[elegant piano music]": null, "Oscar: So I guess, yeah, so the eye can follow the olive branch as it": null, "lands on Rue's head.": null, "Emily: Direct all of the eyesight to Rue.": null, "Aabria: Yes, perfect.": null, "Oscar: And as I'm walking, it's very similar to a wedding march.

On the right side of the tuft is a collection": null, "of peonies, which is their flower.": null, "Aabria: You mean like the flower right behind you?": null, "Oscar: Yes, very much that, yeah.

Would you\u2014have you met my good friend...": null, "Omar:\u00a0And I turn to just whoever is near me.": null, "Aabria: Roll a d20.": null, "Brennan: [in Captain Hob\u2019s voice] Grabalba, you've got to close! Close!": null, "We can only push so far!": null, "Aabria: Did we ever stop to think that maybe she was the problem?": null, "Brennan: [in Captain Hob\u2019s voice] We know she's a problem, okay? We're": null, "working on it!": null, "Omar: It's an afternoon of nines, 9.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh my god, really? Another 9?": null, "Omar: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Okay, let me just go in my pile. My pile of people.": null, "Omar: I rolled my diplomatic die.": null, "Aabria: You're good. You turn and you see in front of you\u2014we talked": null, "about it before but never really have said it out loud, the leaders, the": null, "premiere members, the stewards of these courts go by titles and not": null, "names, except that one overexposed court, the Seelie Court, and their": null, "whole fucky celebrity culture.

He would've been the king,": null, "like you. It kind of fell apart. I know I'm not supposed to talk about": null, "Aabria: And just immediately starts talking his ear off, and he looks": null, "like he just found a growth.

Okay, great.": null, "Omar:\u00a0And I head up to Rue, and I just take your paws.": null, "Andhera: So great of you to join us at the tea party.": null, "Rue: [clears throat] Why, thank you very much. I'm at a loss for words.": null, "You just grabbed my...": null, "Omar: And I go to give you a hug, and I want to be clear, this is in the": null, "most\u2014I'm trying to think of a way to say this without just making a nerd": null, "reference, but it's the most Gen Z of my old friend kind of like": null, "not\u2014without flinching at all or, like, there's no patronizing tone or": null, "anything in it in any way, it's just a hug, and just,": null, "Andhera: I'm sorry that you felt that you had to do that to begin with.": null, "Omar: And I lean back and just give you a smile.": null, "Oscar: Can I make an Insight check?": null, "Aabria: Please do. Against your Persuasion.": null, "Oscar: A dirty 20.": null, "Omar: Amazing. 7. [laughs]": null, "Aabria: An open book.": null, "Rue: Ah. To be honest, I'm taken aback. This is not what I was expecting": null, "at all. Thank you. This means a lot to me.": null, "Andhera: I understand what it's like to hide aspects of yourself. So,": null, "I'm sorry. But let's not focus on that. Instead, let's bookend this": null, "with, welcome to the party.": null, "Oscar: Suddenly, Rue just thought of literally hiding behind pillars as": null, "Pillar Boy, but then is like, wait a second, I have never seen this": null, "person like that before. You're totally right. I don't know. I'm very": null, "intrigued where I was never intrigued or even interested in you before.": null, "Suddenly, this moment of vulnerability, I'm like, oh my gosh, you have": null, "been hiding. You understand me in a way most people don't. I mean, I": null, "don't say this out loud.": null, "Omar: Mm-hm.": null, "Oscar: This is all in my thoughts. And I blink, and my big owl eyes look": null, "softly onto you and, I mean, I can't really smile because I have a beak,": null, "but you can tell that I'm smiling.": null, "Omar: Your eyes smile.": null, "Oscar: Mm-hm.": null, "Andhera: Great, well, if you'll excuse me, things are about to get very": null, "fucky very quickly. I need to solve a problem I created. I'll see you in": null, "a second.": null, "Omar:\u00a0And I rush back to King Oberon.": null, "Aabria: There's just a little clearing of throat as Wuvvy, who has been": null, "on their arm the entire time, kind of gives you a look, gives you a": null, "little nod.": null, "Andhera: Are you hitting on me?": null, "Wuvvy: What?": null, "Andhera: Shit, I'm... Have a great day! Have a great day, god!": null, "Omar: I turn around and I hustle down the beach.": null, "Andhera: Your highness!": null, "Omar: And I quickly grab the viscountess by the arm.": null, "Aabria: She does not let go easily. She has traded up.": null, "[group laughs and oohs]": null, "Brennan: She's making a move on the married King Oberon?": null, "Aabria: They are fey.": null, "Brennan: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Let her shoot her little shot.": null, "Omar: Okay, well in that case, as I tug on the viscountess's arm\u2014": null, "Grabalba: What are you doing?": null, "Omar: I now realize I have\u2014": null, "Omar: \u2014no idea what to do, and a little storm cloud forms over my head,": null, "and I'm happy to leave it there.": null, "Grabalba: Don't rain on my parade.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0She does her best to kick you.": null, "Andhera: I'm sure the highness is quite busy.": null, "Grabalba: [through gritted teeth] We're having a lovely conversation!": null, "Andhera: Okay, one second, King Oberon\u2014": null, "Grabalba: Go away!": null, "Andhera: [straining] I will be right back with you in one quick second\u2014": null, "Grabalba: I will eat your face off! Go!": null, "Andhera: I'm positive you will!": null, "Omar: And I detach, and then look at King Oberon. What is King Oberon's": null, "face going like? I did not mean to take up this much time.": null, "Aabria: No, it's all good. He is still confused about how this happened,": null, "and all of his sense of propriety, he doesn't know how to extricate": null, "himself cleanly, and he's just like,": null, "King Oberon:\u00a0This is a lovely conversation between... royals.": null, "Andhera: In that case, I will stick around as a royal as well just to": null, "continue the conversation.": null, "King Oberon: That would be great, thank you. How are you? How's your": null, "mother?": null, "Andhera: [laughs grandly] Breezy.": null, "Aabria: He laughs way too hard at that.": null, "[Andhera and King Oberon laugh normally then awkwardly]": null, "King Oberon: I'm sweaty.

A human.": null, "Oscar: Could I make a History roll?": null, "Aabria: Yes, please do.": null, "Oscar: In terms of, like, is this the first human that's ever appeared": null, "at the Bloom?": null, "Aabria: Give it with advantage.": null, "Oscar: Okay.": null, "Omar: Oh, must be nice.": null, "Aabria: Imagine.": null, "Oscar: It's a 14.": null, "Aabria: With a 14, occasionally fey drag or cajole or trick or steal": null, "humans into their realm.

That's a better way. I said it kind of confusing,": null, "yes.

Whatever vial you wish.": null, "Wannessa: Whichever one I want?": null, "Rue: Yeah, whichever one you want, unless you have a preference,": null, "Gwyndolin, which vial you would like to choose.": null, "Gwyndolin: Well, why don't\u2014we can\u2014it's one vial per person, or?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, it's about enough to throw a little shot of something": null, "inside a cup of tea, but none of them are labeled.": null, "Surena: Okay, and are they set up like this? How are we\u2014or are there": null, "just colors?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, they're just lined up as a little rainbow.": null, "Aabria: There's 12 of them.": null, "Gwyndolin: Let me look at you.": null, "Surena: And I'm going to try to roll Arcana to see if I can see her": null, "aura, her energy. I want to find her color.": null, "Aabria: Okay, yeah, for sure.": null, "Surena: Okay. That is a dirty 20.": null, "Aabria: Oh my gosh. She is absolutely giving purple.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Great.": null, "Gwyndolin: You are this purple here.": null, "Wannessa: Am I gonna die?": null, "Gwyndolin: You're not gonna die. I will sip it first.": null, "Rue: Oh.": null, "Gwyndolin: I will sip it first, and yes.": null, "Rue: That is a grand gesture among the fey, child, for someone to offer": null, "a drink first.": null, "Rue: It's a high honor.": null, "Surena: I sip the purple.": null, "Aabria: Okay. The moment it touches your lips, the entire vial": null, "disappears and the effect takes hold. That was a Potion of Detect": null, "Thoughts.": null, "Oscar: Ooh!": null, "Surena: [chuckles] Okay.": null, "Aabria: So everyone in this group, is there anyone whose mind you would": null, "like to press into?": null, "Surena: Not knowing anything that's happening, I would kind of press": null, "into Rue, because I'm right here.": null, "Aabria: Okay, what are your surface thoughts in this moment?": null, "Oscar: \u201cFuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This is my": null, "real self. Oh my gosh. I can't believe people are, like, digging it,": null, "maybe? That's crazy.\u201d": null, "Oscar: \u201cI should've done this forever ago.

That would be actually very good": null, "for me.": null, "Rue: All right, but, I mean, you wouldn't be participating in the fairy": null, "teatime. Wouldn't that be fun for someone like you?": null, "Aabria: Persuasion or Intimidation.": null, "Oscar: Ooh. You know, fey can be really\u2014I'll do an Intimidation, and I'm": null, "a fucking owlbear right now.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[laughs] Let\u2019s go.": null, "Lou: Let's do it!": null, "Emily: Don't you roll Intimidation with advantage or something? Didn't": null, "that happen?": null, "Surena: Oh, it was the last session, with the quills.": null, "Oscar: Oh, with the quills.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Battle fit.": null, "Oscar: So that is a 16.": null, "Aabria: Oh my god, that'll still do.

Oh boy.": null, "Surena: Oh no.": null, "Aabria: Well, she's looking at you, and she goes from terrified in her": null, "eyes, slack, and relax, and she kind of just leans forward as a Philter": null, "of Love takes effect.": null, "Aabria: She is charmed by you for the next hour.": null, "Emily: Ooh!": null, "Omar: Wait.": null, "Emily: Who isn't, though?": null, "Omar: How close is she standing to me?": null, "Aabria: I'm assuming you're all in close proximity at this table.": null, "Omar: If she's within 10 feet, she can't be.": null, "Omar: But for the fun storytelling element of it, I will get distracted": null, "by something and go,": null, "Andhera: Would you excuse me a moment?

You should do it now.": null, "Andhera: I'll do it in a second, goddamn. Get off my ass, everybody,": null, "geez.": null, "Omar: And I get out of the 10 feet, so now you are no longer protected": null, "from being charmed.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, yeah, she just falls more, like,": null, "Wannessa:\u00a0[sighs dreamily] What's your whole deal?": null, "Rue: I'm sorry? May I please have the green vial?": null, "Aabria: Oh yeah, called shot? I love this.

What's the difference?": null, "Gwyndolin: A labyrinth can go on and on and on and on and on forever.": null, "Forever, truly forever.
