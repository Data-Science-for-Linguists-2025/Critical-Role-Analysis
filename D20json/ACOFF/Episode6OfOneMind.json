Three of our lovely players have dinged a": null, "positive reputation condition now, so we're going to go around and talk": null, "about what new epithet our high society here is now chasing with your": null, "name. Let's go ahead and start with Omar and Andhera.": null, "Omar: Ooh, I would like to say as folks observed, Andhera on the steed": null, "racing through very quickly and riding with perfect posture, either": null, "\u201cstatued\u201d or \u201cstatuesque\u201d.": null, "Aabria: Ooh.": null, "Omar: Thank you.": null, "Aabria: That's great.": null, "Oscar: Those chiseled muscles help too, yes.": null, "Aabria: We love that.": null, "Omar: You all saw them during the duel.": null, "Aabria: The one you lost?

Nothing, you're good.": null, "Omar: So odd.": null, "Aabria: Weird. What about you, Captain Hob?": null, "Brennan: The major success Captain Hob has had at the Bloom was the": null, "victory in that duel, so I think it stands to reason even as his stars": null, "continue to rise, that was the big pinnacle of it, I think. The epithet": null, "shall be \u201cformidable\u201d.": null, "Emily: Ooh!": null, "Surena: That's great.": null, "Aabria: Yes.": null, "Oscar: Yes.": null, "Aabria: And last but not least, Rue.": null, "Oscar: After Rue's showing of self, the word around the court is that we": null, "are now seeing true Rue, or Rue the True.": null, "Surena: Mm.": null, "Aabria: I love that.": null, "Surena: Rue the True!": null, "Lou: It rhymes.": null, "Aabria: True is so\u2014oh yeah, that's right in that, like, small word with": null, "such a pulse of energy around it.

Rumors.": null, "[mischievous instrumental music]": null, "Lou: Mm!": null, "Emily: Rumors.": null, "Lou: S-P-I-C-Y!": null, "Brennan: [singing]\u00a0Rumor has it.": null, "Aabria: Remember, there's a couple that are floating. I'll give you a": null, "quick reminder. Captain Hob was seen courting Gwyn to try and salvage": null, "the alliance. The Lords of the Wing can't fight for shit without help.": null, "That was elevated to a scandalous sort of talk around the society. The": null, "Sea Foam Court believes that the Court of Wonder is taking": null, "disproportionate credit for the Bloom's success. We have that Theodore,": null, "our lovely friend from the Court of Hoof and Claw, caught feelings, and": null, "Squak let them down very gently. We have another scandal that Andhera's": null, "combat prowess is lacking, especially in matters of war, and a scandal": null, "that somehow this Bloom somehow or someway is the last Bloom of its": null, "type, or just the last Bloom. We don't really know why. And finally, we": null, "have one more sort of rumor in the streets that Andhera was brought to": null, "the Bloom by force, against his will. So, for what it's worth, if no one": null, "reinvests energy in those rumors, they will begin to fade, so as ever,": null, "you have the option to put a new rumor into play, scandalize a rumor by": null, "affirming it and heightening it, or keep an old rumor alive by sort of": null, "just putting more energy back into it. So let's go reverse order and": null, "start with Surena.": null, "Lou: Mm.": null, "Surena: Ooh, okay, so I\u2014": null, "Lou: I feel things quietly and gutturally.": null, "Surena: Ooh, I love it. Love that note!": null, "Lou: Let my throat do what it do.": null, "Surena: With you feeling things.": null, "Lou: Yes!": null, "Surena: I feel like because you were so active in Apollo's side in the": null, "maze, I feel like it's definitely a rumor that you were actively": null, "courting Apollo.": null, "Omar: Ooh!": null, "Oscar: Yes yes yes yes yes.": null, "Aabria: Now, would BINX have either initiated or been a part of the": null, "spreading of that rumor?": null, "Surena: Ooh, interesting. I feel like the way that BINX talks is super": null, "plain.": null, "Aabria: Mm-hm.": null, "Surena: And so I wonder if it was a conversation that she and Rue had": null, "been having, and noticing it, and maybe because Rue has hushed tones and": null, "other things, maybe in a large joke or something louder than whisper,": null, "BINX said something.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Okay, Oscar.": null, "Oscar: I want to start a rumor which started right before the hedge maze": null, "event that your one and only iconic Grabalba just wants to get with any": null, "archfey. She's a bit of a floozy, that one.": null, "Brennan: Oh!": null, "Oscar: She was caught being surrounded by\u2014": null, "Brennan: These big old fuzzy ears better not hear any fucking word of": null, "that, or it's hands on\u2014not sight, but sound.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. And as ever, did Rue have any hands in the generation": null, "or dissemination of this rumor?": null, "Oscar: Rue is not... They're not about that. We all saw what we saw.": null, "Surena: Saw what we saw.": null, "Aabria: Amazing.": null, "Oscar: We got eyes. We all saw what we saw.": null, "[Brennan laughs]": null, "Aabria: Amazing!": null, "Omar: All got eyes.": null, "Aabria: That's so fucked up. I love that. [laughs] Okay, what you got": null, "for me, Lou?": null, "Lou: I'm gonna say that there is a lot of talk about Rue and the Court": null, "of Craft, and the fact that the two of them\u2014I mean, everyone watched": null, "them appear in the hedge maze together, so I think I'm gonna have it": null, "help scandalize the rumor that's already in the mix of the Sea Foam": null, "Court being undermined, that this is yet another play by the Court of": null, "Wonder to make this their event.": null, "[cast oohs]": null, "Surena: Oh yeah.": null, "Oscar: Okay!": null, "Aabria: I love you.": null, "Lou: To bring the last member of a forlorn court to this event.": null, "Emily: So dramatic, taking up.": null, "Lou: Just one more punching down on the Court of Sea Foam.": null, "Oscar: And who started that rumor?": null, "Lou: I don't know. [whispering] It was me.": null, "[players laughing]": null, "Aabria: Is that true?": null, "Lou: Yeah, why not? 100%.": null, "Oscar: And you're like, \u201ctell them it was me\u201d?": null, "Lou: No, I don't think I was like, \u201ctell them it was me.\u201d": null, "Oscar: Okay.": null, "Lou: But I think as we exited the hedge maze, there was just a lot of,": null, "wow.": null, "Aabria hands Lou a jewel.": null, "Aabria: Here.": null, "Lou: Oh, there it is!": null, "Aabria: We love\u2014": null, "Lou: I like all of my shiny things.": null, "Aabria: You got the, like\u2014": null, "Lou: I feel very much like one of those birds that Brennan will name now": null, "that really enjoys sparkly things.": null, "Emily: Magpie.": null, "Surena: Magpie.": null, "Brennan: Magpies and also bowerbirds.": null, "Lou: There it is.": null, "Aabria: I've never heard of a bowerbird.": null, "Lou: You take your pick, which one am I? Am I a magpie or a bowerbird?": null, "Brennan: Bowerbirds like a lot of different textures and qualities of": null, "light.": null, "Lou: Then let's go magpie.": null, "Aabria: You heard textures are an option and went, \u201cno thank you.\u201d": null, "Lou: No. Too much, too much.": null, "Aabria: Incredible. Yeah, Emily.": null, "Emily: I think I feel good with my rumors I started before. I definitely": null, "like what Lou just said, so anything I can do to amp that up.": null, "Emily: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: It is currently at a scandal. If at any point during this phase": null, "you can think of a way to make it just a little\u2014": null, "Emily: Can I use it just to really spread it amongst the Sea Foam Court,": null, "just to really get it under the Sea Foam Court's skin?": null, "Aabria: Absolutely.": null, "Lou: Ooh, they're seething.": null, "[Emily laughs]": null, "Aabria: I love that you've gone out of your way to make sure the people": null, "that would be most proactive about doing something about the scandal are": null, "absolutely getting it in their ear the whole time. That's perfect.": null, "Aabria: Okay, Brennan.": null, "Brennan: So this is the first rumor phrase we've had since the duel.": null, "Aabria: Yeah.": null, "Brennan: So the fallout from the duel, and I think this rumor was": null, "actually going on at the beach and during the hedge maze, post-Hob's": null, "statement of after the duel, kind of saying, like, hey, without saying": null, "it definitively, the Viscountess Grabalba's rejections of a proposal of": null, "marriage should be respected in the future, and saying that at a moment": null, "where Rue had challenged me, or Rue's assistant in their honor": null, "challenged me to a duel, Blemish and Boil have been hard at work": null, "spreading the rumor, and I'm gonna bump it all the way up to a scandal.": null, "Aabria: Okay.": null, "Brennan: Which is, sensing that the cat's out of the bag in terms of the": null, "engagement being called off, like that we can't put that toothpaste back": null, "in the tube, it's too juicy, the rumor erupts into a scandal that the": null, "Prince Apollo did call off the marriage, because his dear friend and": null, "fellow member of the Court of Wonder, Rue, was so desperately in love": null, "with the Viscountess Grabalba that they wanted to propose.": null, "[Surena gasps]": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And so it is a way to accommodate what people are already": null, "saying, which is that the Court of Wonder called it off, but to make it": null, "rather than a judgment on the Goblin Court, it is instead doubly": null, "shameful for both Prince Apollo to have called it off, and to do so": null, "because Delloso de la Rue was so desperately, madly in love with the": null, "viscountess.": null, "Lou: Nasty, nasty!": null, "Emily: That's crazy.": null, "Aabria: Yeah!": null, "Emily: How are you ever gonna... Oh my god!": null, "Aabria: Incredible, and Hob is a part of the dissemination of that": null, "rumor?": null, "Brennan: No. No, Hob is not. Hob has been\u2014": null, "Emily: Coward.": null, "Oscar: Coward! Coward.": null, "Emily: Throwing a bomb out there and putting it in someone else's hand.": null, "Aabria: So Blemish and Boil are absolutely responsible for this, but how": null, "soon into its sort of osmosis into talk did Hob learn about this?": null, "Brennan: Hob doesn't need to take more responsibility for this. He's the": null, "one who said the thing at the duel. The genesis of this, that Rue": null, "proposed marriage to Grabalba, that was from him. He doesn't need to put": null, "more gas on the fire. He started the fire. He lets the goblins that talk": null, "do it. He was the one who kicked this snowball down the hill, you know?": null, "He's not going to take any part in it after that initial show.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, love it. Okay, Omar.": null, "Lou tears a piece of paper.": null, "Aabria: Hold on, how'd you do with that tear, paper boy?": null, "Lou presents a curved scrap of torn paper.": null, "Lou: Bad!": null, "Surena: Paper shark!": null, "Brennan: Like a shark dorsal fin. It's like a \"Jaws\" kind of...": null, "Omar: You keep tearing Half Dome, it's amazing.": null, "Lou presents two curved scraps of torn paper.": null, "Lou: Number one, number two.": null, "Emily: They're getting smaller!": null, "Lou: Yeah, well\u2014I just like to think I thinned out. This one does": null, "CrossFit and this one does not.": null, "Emily: Ooh, okay.": null, "Omar: I see, I see.": null, "Emily: One's bulking, one's cutting.": null, "Aabria: It's a functional strength.": null, "Lou: This one's cutting. Because I heard there's a ball coming up.": null, "Aabria: Ooh, and right, there is. Omar.": null, "Omar: Okay, so we get two rumors, and we also get to try to eliminate a": null, "rumor if we burn one of our pieces, is that right?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, we'll come back around and do that, too.": null, "Omar: Okay, I'm going to address a rumor whether I can burn it later or": null, "not. We'll figure it out in a second, I suppose. When I stepped away in": null, "episode four from our table and I was affecting Wannessa in terms of": null, "the, you know.": null, "Omar: \u201cCan she be charmed, can she not be charmed\u201d. I would like for": null, "that to be the moment that I go to just spread some rumors.": null, "Aabria: Love that.": null, "Omar: I'm pulled away when I hear people talking about the duel that": null, "happened between Captain Hob and myself, and when I step away, I would": null, "like to say something to the effect of, like,": null, "Andhera: I heard you speaking about the occurrence between me and the": null, "captain. I'm afraid the actual dramatic events are much less dramatic in": null, "actuality, and the captain himself is a paragon of gentlemanly warfare": null, "conduct, and the reason that even occurred is because he was following": null, "the rules of warfare itself.": null, "Omar:\u00a0And then in that conversation, I would like to plant two rumors.": null, "Omar: One of which is that, in fact, I would say,": null, "Andhera: Everyone is speaking about how badly we treat the Goblin Court": null, "in terms of our proceedings towards them, that we say things like they": null, "eat their own refuse and they indulge in their highest interests. But": null, "who amongst us\u2014": null, "Omar: And I would point to someone who makes plants happen that's eating": null, "a salad, or someone who represents small creatures is eating a snail or": null, "something.": null, "Andhera: Who amongst us couldn't say the same of ourselves? And are we": null, "not here at the Bloom to do the same thing as the Goblin Court is? So": null, "anyone mistreating the goblins, I think, are going to come into some": null, "very unfortunate light, if I'm being quite honest.": null, "Omar: And I'll use that to slide into my second rumor, which is,": null, "Andhera: It makes sense, why not would my mother, the Queen of Air and": null, "Darkness, send me here specifically to get the ear of one Viscountess": null, "Graba... But I've said too much. [chuckles]": null, "Aabria: Oh!": null, "Andhera: Would you excuse me? I wouldn't want to tip everyone's horns": null, "towards the true diamond of the crown jewel that is this event, so if": null, "you'll excuse me.": null, "Omar: And I leave that table, having planted those two rumors.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Amazing.": null, "Omar: Then I come back a couple seconds later, as I did with Wannessa,": null, "shifting in and out, and I'm just like,": null, "Andhera: Oh shit, I forgot my wallet. I'm so sorry. Let me grab that. If": null, "I was caught at the bar, I'd be fucked. And now I'm back. Great.": null, "Omar: So those are the two that I plant.": null, "Aabria: Okay, I would love to elevate the rumor about Squak actively": null, "courting Prince Apollo. It's now a scandal, in the best possible way.": null, "Emily: I was thinking of doing that one, too.": null, "Emily: I was like, this works for us.": null, "Aabria: Everyone that\u2019s got money on the original bet from the very": null, "first chapter is now seeing and hoping and mapping a lot of intention": null, "and progress onto this, and everyone is sort of watching Lord Airavis": null, "with bated breath.": null, "Brennan: [gasps] What's he gonna do?": null, "Lou: I don't know. Maybe I'll have sex with the prince.": null, "Oscar: Love! It's love!": null, "Lou: Oh wait, that's right.": null, "Oscar: It's love.": null, "Brennan: We only have five episodes left for this wager. Tick tock, tick": null, "tock.": null, "Lou: Please, I can fall in love in an episode. Oh shit, do we like some": null, "of the same shit? Okay, maybe I love you.": null, "Brennan: What a bleak outlook on love.": null, "Omar: This is so convenient. We're in our thirties.": null, "Lou: Give me 120 minutes, done.": null, "Brennan: Hey, if we moved in together, our rent would be $450 each.": null, "Lou: And I love a deal.": null, "Aabria: Ow, it hurts us. Mm-mm.": null, "Aabria: Okay, so now is the opportunity. You have the rumors out on the": null, "board. They're beginning to be spread. If you would like to kill any of": null, "them, it will cost you a token to do so. Is there anything you want": null, "gone?": null, "[lively folk music]": null, "Brennan holds up his dagger.": null, "Oscar: Ooh.": null, "Emily: What?": null, "Brennan: Over our cups in the goblin pagoda on an evening where we have": null, "invited all of the other courts to come, where we will be on our best": null, "goblin behavior to make a massive bonfire and drink blood wine and make": null, "merry, Captain Hob holds court, sharing many war stories of the Prince": null, "Andhera's incredible prowess in battle.": null, "Oscar: Oh my gosh!": null, "Surena: Aw!": null, "Brennan: And opines in matters martial and military that, in fact, to": null, "have dodged his first strike in the wrestling match is a feat that few": null, "others here could boast, and many of the salt goblins, deep in their": null, "cups, sing a very mocking, sing-song ballad about an unnamed fairy": null, "princess who was trapped on the back of a horse by a clever prince and": null, "sent riding over the hills.": null, "[cast applauding]": null, "Surena: That's so good!": null, "Emily: Oh, yay!": null, "Brennan hands Aabria the dagger.": null, "Aabria: Beautifully done. So with that said, the rumors are handled, the": null, "state is declared, and now we open it up, as we love to do, with an": null, "epistolary phase. Letters, my friends. If anyone is ready to go, please": null, "jump in. If not, I am happy to begin.": null, "Brennan: [gasps] You have one?": null, "Aabria: Of course I do.": null, "Brennan: Oh.": null, "Emily: Oh.": null, "Aabria: All right, so, a note with a gift is delivered to the goblin": null, "pagoda by a being that looks sort of roughly humanoid, devoid of really": null, "any sort of specific features. It seems to be made of wet sand, and at": null, "all points of interaction or articulation, sort of falls away to the": null, "ground and is regenerated as they walk, carrying a two-foot-wide clam": null, "shell of ivory, and that very specific red of the sky that sailors fear": null, "in the morning before a storm comes in, and they come to you and present": null, "you with a clam, and the accompanying note has a story written in it": null, "about a mortal mother who warns her three children to not go out on a": null, "thin veil night, lest they be swept up by the workings of the fey, and": null, "they go out regardless, and find a beautiful, dark pony, and the moment": null, "they mount it, the pony breaks for the ocean and throws itself into the": null, "sea and neighs and whinnies happily as the children are drowned, and": null, "this story of a moment of trickster glory between those of sea foam and": null, "those that are goblin is heralded and remembered by the Sea Foam Court": null, "as this clam shell contains a pile of refuse, of notes, drafts of things": null, "delivered, thrown-away notes that were received, and just anything that": null, "the Sea Foam Court would think to be of interest to Captain Hob.": null, "[regal string music]": null, "Brennan: I pen a quick response to return, as I stand there to the": null, "messenger, that says,": null, "Captain Hob:": null, "\u201cTo the honorable bearers of this gift, my gratitude knows no bounds,": null, "and my thanks are given to you freely and gladly. We kneel in deference": null, "to this, the most glorious Bloom we have attended, which is, in all of": null, "its magnificence, a testament solely to the honor of the Sea Foam": null, "Court.\u201d": null, "Aabria: Nicely done, and this wet sand being takes your response away,": null, "walking slowly back to whoever their master is. The note was unsigned,": null, "but you know it was from someone high up.": null, "Brennan: K.P. leaves his one unsigned as well.": null, "Aabria: Love it.": null, "Surena: Wow.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna put the story in my own, take the story and keep that": null, "separate, put the clam with any of the other papers we have gathered,": null, "which, it's my nearest intention after the epistolary phase to dive into": null, "all of that.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, cool. Anyone else got a letter?": null, "Lou: Sure. This one, all letters written by Squak from now on will be": null, "written in illusory script.": null, "Lou: Anyone who they are not addressed to, it says I'm thanking them for": null, "a book recommendation.": null, "Aabria: Yes!": null, "Surena: Perfect.": null, "Emily:\u00a0Can I fabricate a fake Squak reading a book in our window?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0He just loves loves reading!": null, "Squak: This one's called \"The Green Hunter\".

Ooh!": null, "Squak: It's like two games in one. One is the feeling, and then in": null, "addition, it's like, when I find it\u2026": null, "Chirp: Ooh, every time it lands. Ooh, ooh! Ooh, ooh!": null, "Squak: Where will he go next? [posh laugh]": null, "Chirp: Okay, sorry.": null, "Squak: Anyway, no, he seems to be very mad.

I'm not sure I could separate where the": null, "love is, if it's for him or just the idea that to be with him means that": null, "every eye of this court is on me.": null, "Chirp: Cousin, based on the way you just said it.": null, "Chirp: It's the latter.": null, "Squak: Well, I think we both knew.": null, "Chirp: Okay, because we have this wager for us to fall in love.": null, "Squak: Yes, I know.": null, "Chirp: So I want to know, should I be helping you with this endeavor?": null, "Squak: I don't know!": null, "Chirp: Okay, okay. You just need time to find out.": null, "Squak: I think so. I think\u2014you know what? I'm just going to apologize.": null, "Let's not make this the thing. You know, I'm happy to upset K.P.

I take my right hand.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Are you dual wielding quills right now?": null, "Squak: Go ahead.": null, "Emily: I'll just say what it is. I'm going to summon Flock of Familiars": null, "to summon a bunch of salt goblins, and then I'm going to write a note in": null, "one of the goblin's hands that's to Rue that's just kind of like, \u201cthank": null, "you for a lovely hedge maze, it was so fun.\u201d But then the illusory": null, "script will be from me, just saying,": null, "Chirp:": null, "\u201cDearest Rue,": null, "It is I, Lady Featherfowl.

Can I get a Deception check? I'll give you advantage": null, "because you've spent good magic.": null, "Emily: I am a forger, yeah yeah, so I think advantage, okay.": null, "Emily: 22.": null, "Aabria: Oh yeah. You can even kind of hear the pulse of rumors as, like,": null, "\u201cWhat are the goblins sending to the Court of Wonder, ooh?\u201d It's": null, "absolutely maintained the illusion of that, that's great.": null, "Oscar: What letter were you going to write?": null, "Lou: Oh, I think my response to Hob is short and sweet. It's like": null, "something to the extent of,": null, "Squak:\u00a0": null, "\u201cTo the formidable Hob! I deeply apologize for my misspeaking. The heat": null, "of the moment caught me in a tizzy, and I was unable to find the correct": null, "words in which to describe the most\u2026\u201d": null, "Lou: If I described the viscountess as nasty, would that be a compliment": null, "or a bad thing?": null, "Brennan: Actually, nasty or beautiful, we take it all as compliments.": null, "Emily: Similar, honestly.": null, "\u201cYour nastiest and most beautiful viscountess.

One star.": null, "Aabria: Oh no!": null, "Brennan: The Lord Airavis's Letterboxd is absolutely ruthless.": null, "Lou: Everything has one star, except...": null, "Surena: I have two letters.": null, "Surena: One is very short and is not warranting a response.": null, "Omar: Oh.": null, "Surena: It's right after the hedge maze. Gwyndolin, or BINX, oh my god,": null, "BINX is in her little hovel, essentially, and she's pacing. She's like,": null, "BINX: I said it. I said the thing, right?": null, "Aabria: Wait, question.": null, "Surena: Yes.": null, "Aabria: Where is BINX staying?": null, "Surena: You know, where all of the fey are staying, the main boarding": null, "place, right? Is there a place like that?": null, "Aabria: The main palace is where most of the archfey are staying unless": null, "they brought their own accommodations, like the goblin pagoda or the": null, "nest.": null, "Surena: BINX, given liminal spaces and all of that, she's in the castle,": null, "but she has sort of created a void space for herself that is under a": null, "radiator.": null, "Surena: So it's a place that nobody thinks about or notices, and in that": null, "liminal space, she just has all of her shit.": null, "Aabria: I love it.": null, "Surena: She has her curios. It looks like an antique store in her house.": null, "Surena: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Okay, sorry, that was great. Continue.": null, "Surena: Yes, so she's pacing, and she goes through this large barrel she": null, "has of various fruits and vegetables, and she finds another black apple,": null, "and it is this deep, inky, inky onyx color. She looks at it, and it is": null, "the finest fruit she owns, and on the stem of the apple, she scrawls,": null, "\u201cThank you for seeing me.\u201d Puts it, ties it with that, and in the dead": null, "of night, it is nighttime, because BINX doesn't have any attendants.": null, "Surena: So BINX creeps to where you were.": null, "Omar: Mm-hm.": null, "Surena: So, creeps to, where is Andhera staying?": null, "Omar: I think in just a different wing.": null, "Omar: Yeah.": null, "Surena: So, sneaks through the hallways of this wing, clutching this": null, "apple.": null, "Aabria: I'm gonna need a Stealth check.": null, "Surena: Uh-huh.

You make your way.": null, "Surena: Okay, so.": null, "Aabria: What?": null, "Surena: It's not great. Not great for me. Yeah, so I creep to where I": null, "believe you are.": null, "Surena: I set it down.": null, "Aabria: Grandpa dog for sure comes up.": null, "Aabria: What does he do when he sees? I don't know how much you and": null, "grandpa dog talk.": null, "Omar: I speak around grandpa dog quite often. Not necessarily to grandpa": null, "dog a whole lot.": null, "Omar: I believe the only word that grandpa dog has uttered thus far is": null, "the word \u201cshit\u201d.": null, "Aabria: That sounds right.": null, "Oscar: And, very quietly, \u201ckill me.\u201d": null, "Omar: Enough of that, grandpa dog.": null, "Aabria: Then as you approach, grandpa dog is going to sort of raise up": null, "out of the darkness, and you see just tiny red points, like light": null, "reflecting off of the back of his eyes, but there is no light in this": null, "room as he stalks towards you, growling and baring his teeth.": null, "Surena: The things I know about dogs are from the mortal realm, and I'm": null, "going to submit.

Do I have pudding in this moment?": null, "Oscar: Pudding?": null, "Surena: Not chocolate pudding.": null, "Aabria: The moment you flop onto your back, he grows silent and kind of": null, "pads over to you, and then just sort of lays down next to you and rests": null, "his chin on the ground, just looking at you.": null, "BINX: Hey, buddy. You're a good boy. You're a good boy.": null, "Surena: I'm gonna try to wiggle. I'm on my back still, but I'm trying to": null, "wiggle closer to the door.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, he's gonna allow it.": null, "BINX: You're so cute. You're just a...": null, "Grandpa Dog: Thanks.": null, "Surena: I was not expecting it to talk. Ew, I hate it!": null, "Aabria: It's not good. It's not good when he chooses to do it.": null, "Surena: Sets down the apple.": null, "BINX: That's a present. That's a present. You cool?": null, "Aabria: Just gives a little snort.": null, "Surena: I'm just gonna... Because I don't know.": null, "Surena: I don't know if it's gonna come for me.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, if you are careful, he will allow you to leave without": null, "really remarking. He kind of looks over at the apple, looks down at the": null, "jerky next to him, and then just returns his chin to his hands and": null, "continues his watch.": null, "Surena: Good. Thanks, great.": null, "Aabria: This is good.": null, "Surena: The next is a letter letter, and it says,": null, "BINX:": null, "\u201cDear Hob,": null, "We must meet, as I believe we may have more in common than you know.": null, "Meet me at the abandoned tailor's just outside the reach of the Bloom.\u201d": null, "Surena: And it's signed Gwyn.": null, "Brennan: I look at this.

Could you imagine?": null, "Surena: Oh my god, it's great. As BINX is running to the tailor's,": null, "because it is very far outside of the Bloom and they have to get there": null, "because they don't know how fast Hob is and doesn't know if Hob is gonna": null, "get there first and be alone, so in their haste, they're writing this": null, "letter back to Gwyndolin as they're running and it says,": null, "\u201cDear Gwyndolin,": null, "Things have changed in that we might not have as much time as we had": null, "normally anticipated.

Guys.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Guys, come on.": null, "Salt Goblin: Interesting that you would.": null, "BINX: Yeah, so it is expected that you would betray me, so what is the": null, "most goblin thing to do, if I expect you to betray me?": null, "Salt Goblin: You playing mind games with me?": null, "BINX: I don't know, do you play mind games with me?": null, "Salt Goblin: Oh shit, I think I'm in love.": null, "Aabria: Make an Intimidation check.": null, "Surena: Oh no.

You are here as my guest, in my own quarters.": null, "Rue: I would kindly suggest that you respect my friend BINX as well as": null, "me, and keep what was said in my quarters to yourself.": null, "Salt Goblin: That was terrifying.

And he just falls right over.": null, "BINX: I panicked! I panicked, oh god.": null, "Rue: We should've done that from the beginning.": null, "BINX: I thought we could reason with him, but then apparently he just": null, "kept talking, and I was like, I guess this is what we're doing!": null, "Rue: No, I understand, it was a very, very scrappy salt goblin.": null, "Aabria: He's just asleep on your shoulder.": null, "Brennan: Somewhere, Hob is like, \u201cput him in a Mason jar! A Mason jar!\u201d": null, "Aabria: Poke a hole in it! Hole in the lid!": null, "Rue: I'm sorry, my dear BINX, you are going to have counsel with Hob at": null, "the moment?": null, "BINX: Yes, I think that he can help me.": null, "Rue: With what?": null, "BINX: With finding information. You know, the thing we talked about.": null, "Rue: Of course.": null, "BINX: But I think that he can help me find information. I know that": null, "there's, like...": null, "Rue: What are you talking about?": null, "BINX: You know, like?\u00a0Okay, but, I mean...": null, "Rue: Is it obvious?": null, "BINX: So, I watch a lot, and I noticed a lot.": null, "Rue: People can tell?": null, "BINX: No, I can tell.": null, "Rue: Are people talking?": null, "BINX: A little bit.": null, "[Rue sighs]": null, "BINX: But\u2014just listen.

Just the thought of him, the thought of": null, "seeing him, makes me\u2014": null, "BINX: What does it make you?": null, "Rue: I don't know, sweaty.": null, "Rue: Yes, thank you. He just makes me so happy. There's something about": null, "his presence. I barely know him, but I feel like I understand him so": null, "well. You talk about twin flame, but to me, there's something deeper": null, "than that, hotter, fierier than just a flame. Am I being ridiculous?": null, "BINX: No, no, please. Listen, life is really short, and I know it": null, "doesn't make sense because we're supposed to live forever, but turns": null, "out, we don't, okay? So if you feel something, and this is maybe the": null, "last Bloom.": null, "Rue: Allegedly, yes.": null, "BINX: Then, you know, maybe it's worth at least being brave enough to": null, "know, what if?": null, "Rue: What if he does not reciprocate feelings? Because that reality": null, "would be insufferable.": null, "BINX: Would you rather live in a world where you didn't even try? There": null, "is bravery in that, and there's courage in that, and yes, there is the": null, "large, fiery feeling of disappointment and utter heartbreak that might": null, "come with that.": null, "[Rue mumbling]": null, "BINX: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.": null, "[tender instrumental music]": null, "BINX: What I'm saying is, you have to act on the things you feel,": null, "because that is what our magic is made of\u2014feelings, thoughts, ideas.": null, "It's who we are, and if you get tied in the structure of all of the": null, "hierarchy and the manners and the rules and parades, there's so many": null, "parades, if you get tied into that, then what are you doing?

You are fighting for something": null, "larger than just yourself. I will go with you.": null, "Rue: I will provide counsel. I won't say anything, because of course": null, "this is about the two of you, but I'm gonna look sickening, okay?": null, "BINX: All right, all right.": null, "Rue: I will show up and I will wear my hottest outfit.": null, "BINX: We can figure it out. We can look at your stuff right now.": null, "Rue: Let's do it.": null, "Brennan: And on that, yeah, we'll bounce back to Andhera.": null, "Andhera: Great.

Now, I will suck your blood!": null, "Squak: Tea, vodka, wine?": null, "Chirp: Gin?": null, "Squak: Gin? Oh, we're out of vodka, we just have gin.": null, "Andhera: I will have a\u2014": null, "Squak: Or tea, of course, we have tea.": null, "Chirp: We gave our vodka away.": null, "Andhera: Do you have any apple juice?": null, "[Aabria laughs]": null, "Surena:\u00a0[laughing] He\u2019s just seriously asking for apple juice.": null, "Squak: I'm gonna leave the two of you. I'll go see I can\u2014": null, "Chirp: Cousin, why would you do that?": null, "Squak: I'm gonna leave the two of you.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Why would you do that? What are you doing to me?": null, "Squak: I'm gonna see if I can scrounge up some apple juice.": null, "Chirp: Cousin, if you ever want to\u2014": null, "Squak: It's deep underneath the nest.": null, "Chirp: Hey, cousin?": null, "Squak: So I may not be back in a second.

I fail, and I'm not gonna try and Counterspell it or": null, "anything, I'm not really trying to hide anything.": null, "Chirp: Ah, you've cast magic on me.": null, "Andhera: Listen, about that. I am a little bit over my head, if I'm": null, "being quite honest.": null, "Chirp: Really?": null, "Andhera: Yes. I've\u2014how do I put this? I've written checks my body can't": null, "quite cash.": null, "Lou: My head could spin around, fully 360.": null, "Chirp: That's so visceral and visual.": null, "Andhera: I never intended for you to fall madly in love with me. I was": null, "simply playing the game of diplomacy.

I'm so": null, "sorry, and I don't want to break your heart.": null, "Emily: If it's Zone of Truth, do I have to respond truthfully?": null, "Aabria: If you respond, it must be the truth, but you can also abstain": null, "from responding.": null, "Chirp: Hm.

I'll just ask you point": null, "blank, are you in love?": null, "[pause] [Surena groans]": null, "Chirp: Deeply.": null, "[cast shouting]": null, "Andhera: Shit! Oh shit, I knew it!": null, "Squak: Who wants apple juice?

Well, I'm happy to hear": null, "that. Truthfully, I think the world of you both. You always bring so": null, "much fun everywhere.

And we": null, "can bring them back from the dead. We don't have to make it permanent.": null, "Squak: That's why I'm always like, come on, let's get into it! We'll": null, "bring you back!": null, "Andhera: Well, since it's Zone of Truth, is it all right if I call you": null, "Auntie and Uncle?": null, "Chirp: Dispel Magic. No. I need to get out of this situation. Gobble?": null, "Gobble, take him away.": null, "Squak: Enjoy the rest of that apple juice. We never drink it.": null, "Chirp: We never drink it.

What a unique flavor profile.": null, "Thank you, Gobble.": null, "Andhera: I wish you best the both. And also, I know Zone of Truth is": null, "gone, but this is the honest truth, if you need a beard to cover up for": null, "anything\u2014": null, "Oscar: Not a beard! [laughs]": null, "Andhera: Feel free.": null, "Chirp: I don't understand that word.": null, "Squak: Yes, I also am very confused. A beard?": null, "Andhera: Yes, when you're trying to hide a relationship, usually": null, "pertaining to a specific type of relationship, I'm gonna go ahead and": null, "open it up, we're all kind of pan, in a way, at this greater event, if": null, "you need a cover for anything, please feel free, and I promise I won't": null, "make it weird.": null, "Chirp: Well.": null, "Squak: I mean.": null, "Chirp: I mean.": null, "Squak: I think we\u2014well, I think, what a fantastic offer!": null, "Chirp: Yes, why don't you continue throughout this Bloom, and perhaps": null, "you might find a love match, and I would hate to be any sort of barrier": null, "in that endeavor.": null, "Squak: Never.": null, "Andhera: Of course, great, Uncle, Auntie. Sorry, not that.": null, "Chirp: Again, if you are going to propose being my beard, don't call me": null, "Auntie.": null, "Andhera: Yes, I'm sorry, that makes it so strange, doesn't it?": null, "Chirp: If there's ever a world where we find ourselves at the end of the": null, "Bloom and we both enter a loveless but mutually respecting marriage.": null, "Andhera: Right.": null, "Chirp: I can't have you calling me Auntie.": null, "Andhera: Absolutely not, absolutely not, great. Friends?": null, "Chirp: Friends, beautiful.": null, "Squak: Friends.": null, "Andhera: Great, thank you, and thank you. I was a strange child growing": null, "up, and you both just made it fun to be at the Bloom when everyone else": null, "was mean to me, so.": null, "Chirp: We did used to be quite fun at Blooms.": null, "Squak: We did used to be quite fun at Blooms.": null, "Andhera: You still are. You jumped on the table. You jumped on the table": null, "and you said, it's a goddamn Bloom.": null, "Squak: There was that moment, yes.": null, "Squak: And who knows, maybe us being fun will return again.": null, "Squak: Who knows?": null, "Chirp: Maybe us being fun could inject a little amorosity.": null, "Squak: Yes, maybe a bit of high octane excitement from the Lords of the": null, "Wing. Maybe it's just what this Bloom needs.": null, "Chirp: You've given us much to think about, pillar boy.": null, "[pause] [Brennan laughing]": null, "Andhera: Enjoy the rest of your day.": null, "Squak: Of course, and enjoy the apple juice.": null, "Andhera: It's been ruined by the vodka.": null, "Squak: We have more, and we truly do not drink it.": null, "Chirp: We really don't drink it.": null, "Andhera: I'll swing by at a future time.": null, "Squak: We'll send it over. We'll put it on a peacock, don't even worry.": null, "Andhera: You don't have to do that. I will come by.": null, "Squak:\u00a0No, it\u2019s nothing. Shoo, shoo!": null, "Emily: Flock of Familiars. I summon a bunch of peacocks.": null, "Squak: All right, now go, go.": null, "Chirp: The casks of apple juice, please.": null, "Andhera: You're too kind.": null, "Squak: Now go, please.": null, "Squak: Get the hell out of here.": null, "Chirp: Please leave.": null, "Andhera: Too kind.": null, "Squak: Wow.": null, "Aabria: And as you move outside...": null, "Brennan: I'm waiting by the east gate for Andhera.": null, "Aabria: Okay, so you head over?": null, "Omar: I make my way as I kind of wave my robe. Just like, \u201coh, thank": null, "god.\u201d": null, "Omar: \u201cThat went so well.\u201d": null, "Brennan: I think Hob is wearing a greatcoat, so it's like the wide": null, "shoulders, sort of against the rain, and it's much more mottled, there's": null, "no garish colors in it.": null, "[intent instrumental music]": null, "Captain Hob: Your highness.": null, "Captain Hob: Good to see you.": null, "Andhera: You as well.": null, "Captain Hob: Thank you for coming here. I know my request must seem": null, "strange. I'm going to tread dangerously forward into the unknown. Your": null, "house and mine are both creatures of the darkness, and so into the": null, "darkness we must tread. I trust you.": null, "Andhera: And you, Captain.": null, "Captain Hob: No no, I mean to say, I am not a clever man. I am not a man": null, "possessed of affinity for high society. You were born to a family that": null, "has put you in this place, and I was not. I have struggled to stay": null, "afloat in the stormy waters of the Bloom, and I have at many times": null, "failed. When I look to you, I see a man of honor, and perhaps I am a": null, "fool, but I know that I cannot survive this without making some attempt": null, "to trust. So I'm telling you now, Prince Andhera, that I trust you.": null, "Andhera: What an interesting day this is turning out to be, as I am": null, "sharing one of the deepest secrets with many people, it seems, and I": null, "would like to extend to you, Captain, you can trust me with anything,": null, "and I will be candid and honest with you. We met in the fray of battle,": null, "but I believe that our relationship was forged in the quiet serenity of": null, "everyday conduct.": null, "Captain Hob: To maintain one's honor in the face of the trials and": null, "tribulations of life is a constant battle, and so in that way, your": null, "highness, we have never left the battlefield.": null, "Andhera: Shit, yeah, when you put it that way.": null, "Captain Hob: Come walk with me. If you would be a friend to me, I am": null, "headed for a clandestine meeting with one whom I believe is of great": null, "importance to all of the fey herein gathered at the Bloom. It is also": null, "possibly an ambush to murder me and hide my body. So, to that end, it": null, "could also be an attempt to have me arrive at a place of great evil and": null, "frame me for an atrocity that I did not commit. So bringing another": null, "goblin was ruled out, because my court would not be trusted to speak on": null, "its own behalf.": null, "Captain Hob: Bringing a representative of another court means that there": null, "will be a witness to whatever awaits me at this clandestine juncture, do": null, "you understand?": null, "Andhera: Absolutely and completely. In fact, I'll cast Detect Good and": null, "Evil just to be safe.": null, "Captain Hob: Magic seems so useful. What's that like?": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna head off with Prince Andhera.": null, "Aabria: Let's go ahead and bring you all together.": null, "Surena: I think that BINX is Gwyndolin-ified, so she is Gwyndolin right": null, "now. They're waiting behind an old tailor shop. There's mannequins and": null, "clothes that have been abandoned strewn about. It's dusty. The windows": null, "are broken in. And Gwyndolin is nervously\u2014she has this little": null, "jack-in-the-box toy, it's just a wooden toy, and she's just nervously": null, "like, [mimics repeatedly unfurling a jack-in-the-box] poof!": null, "Rue: BINX. BINX.": null, "[tender piano music]": null, "Rue: You look nervous.": null, "BINX: Well, I mean. [changes to Gwyndolin\u2019s voice] I mean! Listen, it's": null, "one of those things where, if this goes wrong, then we\u2019re both\u2014then I": null, "have dragged you into this situation with me, and then you're in": null, "trouble, then I'm in trouble, then we're all fighting, and, what?": null, "Rue: I am here at your side no matter what.": null, "Rue: Whether good or bad, I am here. Trust yourself.": null, "Rue: And if you can't, I want you to think about this. As a child, I was": null, "a wild owlbear that was raised by archfey in the Court of Wonder.": null, "BINX: Wait, you're from the Mortal Plane? Is that...": null, "Rue: I was taken by the archfey, yes. And they raised me to be one of": null, "them. I've always felt not a part of the Court of Wonder society, but I": null, "was terrified. But I would hum a tune that would steel myself in order": null, "to do the things that I needed to get done.": null, "Rue: And if you're nervous, I want you to hum this tune.": null, "Oscar: And I can't hum a tune to save my life, but I'm going to give you": null, "a Bardic Inspiration in case anything sort of happens.": null, "Aabria: And as that happens, you hear the little salt goblin you know": null, "is\u2014": null, "Surena: Which is in, because we were in your room, I put the salt goblin": null, "in a party favor bag that has a window, so it's not in a Mason jar, it's": null, "in a party favor bag. It has, like, stars on it. It says \u201chappy": null, "birthday.\u201d": null, "Surena: And that's where the goblin is in.": null, "Aabria: Then as you're having this moment, Scorple, who is this little": null, "goblin.": null, "Surena: Scorple!": null, "Brennan: Scorple!": null, "Aabria: Just starts banging on the plastic part to get your attention.": null, "Scorple: They're coming!": null, "BINX: Wait, what?": null, "Rue: They're here. They're coming.": null, "BINX: Oh!": null, "Rue: Yes!": null, "BINX: Thank you.": null, "Scorple: I'm not a snitch. I don't want to die. You can let me out, or": null, "open a little more air. It's hot in here.": null, "Surena: Sporadically punch a bunch of holes in it.": null, "Scorple: [inhales] Thanks!": null, "Brennan: As we approach this tailor's shop.": null, "Brennan: First of all, I just want to say, as, really like\u2014these dark,": null, "cloaked Goblin and Unseelie walk through the shadows, I have a good": null, "Stealth, we just look hot. I just want it to be known that we're walking": null, "across a misty moor.": null, "Omar:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Performance check from both of you.": null, "Oscar: Ooh!": null, "Lou: You don't just get to say you look hot.": null, "Aabria: Are you kidding?": null, "Lou: Ooh, that's not a hot face.": null, "Brennan: Okay. 15.": null, "Aabria: That's hot.": null, "Oscar: That's hot.": null, "Omar: Did I get Inspiration at any point?": null, "Aabria: Sure you have. It's not on me to keep up with it.": null, "Omar: Shit, 21.": null, "Aabria: Y'all are cutting a mean figure as the shadows sort of lengthen": null, "and deepen in this sort of forgotten area, 'cause I do want to be clear,": null, "this entire island exists because of the Bloom, but even here in a place": null, "made by the surge of magic, there are forgotten corners, and you were": null, "able to find one, and yeah, cool.": null, "Brennan: As we are approaching, I'm gonna reach into my uniform and pull": null, "out a purple potion, and I'm going to hand it to you and say,": null, "Captain Hob: Good rule of tactics. Never give your opponent the same": null, "trick twice. Better for you to drink that than me.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to let\u2014": null, "Aabria: Detect Thoughts.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna let Andhera drink the Detect Thoughts and look at you": null, "and say,": null, "Captain Hob: If there's anything coming I should know about, give me a": null, "tap of warning on the shoulder.": null, "Andhera: Absolutely.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to walk into this, and note that the leader of": null, "the Court of Craft has summoned us to a tailor shop.": null, "Aabria: Yep.": null, "BINX: Why are they so hot right now? They're just walking. They're hot.": null, "Scorple: Hey yo boss, you look dope!": null, "Captain Hob: Very good, Scorple. At ease.": null, "Aabria: He just lays back down.": null, "Brennan: I see Rue here. I visibly catch my breath in my chest.": null, "Aabria: Insight check.": null, "Oscar: Mm.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I'll roll Deception.": null, "Surena: Oh, I want to help you.": null, "Oscar: 13.": null, "Brennan: 16.": null, "Oscar: Oh ho!": null, "Aabria: You don't clock it.": null, "Brennan: In my head, I'm just like, yeah. Oh, the one person BINX knows": null, "here? Yeah, that's who she'd bring to the thing when you said bring a": null, "second.": null, "Oscar: Yeah, I would have noticed, except I just cannot keep my eyes on": null, "Hob. It would demolish me just by looking at\u2014especially the slow-mo way": null, "in which these two gorgeous figurines just entered the room.": null, "Omar: Raincloud over us as well, I would like to add.": null, "Aabria: Ooh!": null, "Lou: A little wet?": null, "Omar: A little wet.": null, "Lou: A little damp?": null, "Omar: A little 2000s Backstreet Boys action.": null, "Oscar: Exactly!": null, "Surena: Yes!": null, "Lou: Just right here, matted right there.": null, "Omar: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Lou: Little bangs action.": null, "Omar: Can I quickly get everyone to roll for their surface thoughts that": null, "I'm just picking up?": null, "Aabria: Absolutely. There's no roll for the surface thoughts.": null, "Omar: Oh, surface thoughts? That's right, that's right.": null, "Aabria: Surface thoughts are free.": null, "Omar: I'm not pushing any further, so I hear that.": null, "Oscar: I just look away.": null, "Brennan: Oh, you absolutely feel that Hob feels painful shame at how": null, "enamored he is of Rue, and it is a very self-excoriating\u2014it is a feeling": null, "of just like, \u201cyou idiot.\u201d Like, this is never gonna\u2014like, even in the": null, "swell of feeling, there is a self-reproach.": null, "Omar: As I absorb those thoughts and those feelings, the cloud itself": null, "takes on a sea storm kind of vibe, and there's just needles of lightning": null, "cross-crossing and shattering and breaking through the cloud.": null, "Surena: Gwyndolin, BINX's thoughts right now, are just like, \u201cYou got": null, "this?\u201d They're just like inspirational quotes that she's read, and she's": null, "repeating them, so it's like, \u201cYou got this. You can do it. Hang in": null, "there.\u201d It's just those thoughts, and just repeating, repeating,": null, "repeating, and an underscore is a tune.": null, "Omar: And I glance over to you, Rue.": null, "Oscar: I look away. I look down on the floor. I try to\u2014I fuss around": null, "with my gown. I look around at the space and just think, \u201cI've never": null, "been here before.\u201d That's my surface thoughts. \u201cI've never been here": null, "before. What a place. I wonder what's gonna happen, okay.\u201d": null, "Aabria: Scorple's thinking about food. Not that anyone asked.": null, "Brennan: I put my cavalry officer's hat in my hand and stand.": null, "Captain Hob: Ms. Thistle-hop, I believe that Ms. Choppley delivered a": null, "letter on your behalf.": null, "BINX: [still in Gwyn\u2019s voice]\u00a0She did, because there is something that I": null, "must tell you that must remain\u2014hello, hi. Yes, okay. Outside of the": null, "Bloom. And I feel that during tea, you and I exchanged several thoughts": null, "that might have painted me in a light that is different than my intended": null, "purpose.": null, "Captain Hob: Mm. I shall speak plainly, Ms. Thistle-hop.": null, "BINX: Mm-hm.": null, "Captain Hob: It has come to the attention of the Goblin Court that there": null, "may be interlopers of a highly dangerous nature attending this Bloom.": null, "BINX: I knew it.": null, "Captain Hob: Therefore, it is my utmost responsibility to see to the": null, "safety and security of those vassals of his majesty the Goblin King.": null, "Given that I am aware of the fact that whoever you may be, it is not one": null, "Gwyndolin Thistle-hop, you have risen quite high in my list of dangerous": null, "individuals. Do you have a means of dispelling this suspicion on my": null, "behalf?": null, "BINX: I do, but I first have to ask you a question. And since you are": null, "speaking plainly, I expect that, and would expect you to continue to do": null, "so, right?": null, "Captain Hob: I do not have the verbal guile to mislead, so in this": null, "manner, you may trust in my honesty.": null, "Scorple: It's true, this dude's shit for lying.": null, "BINX: He's...": null, "Captain Hob: So nice. Wait a minute. Your servant said the same thing.": null, "BINX: That\u2019s\u2014first of all, BINX is not a servant. They were just doing": null, "me a favor, because they are the only one of the Court of Craft left.": null, "[stammering] It's fine! I need to ask you. How do you feel about the": null, "Court of Wonder? And I need you to speak plainly, understanding that I": null, "am not... I just\u2014I need to know if I can trust you, and I feel that I": null, "can trust everyone here.": null, "Captain Hob: A request made for honesty.": null, "BINX: Yes, please.": null, "Captain Hob: [clears throat] Courts are large, and they encompass": null, "multitudes, and there are those of us who can contradict the nature of": null, "our court. I must make it clear that if I speak in castigation of": null, "certain elements of a fey court, that it does not extend to each and": null, "every member of that court.": null, "BINX: Yes.": null, "Captain Hob: I find the fairies of the Court of Wonder to be arrogant,": null, "vain, haughty, small-minded, and of a nature most unbecoming to those of": null, "us who wish to uphold true values, like rumpus and mischief!": null, "Oscar: I knock over a ventriloquist's dummy by accident. I\u2019m just shook": null, "by that.": null, "Lou: This tailor is fucked up!": null, "Brennan: As you knock that over, I'm gonna say,": null, "Captain Hob:\u00a0Rue, are you\u2014sorry, I don't want to...": null, "Rue: No, no. What?": null, "Captain Hob: I don't mean to\u2014I understand that some members of that": null, "court herein are present, Delloso de la Rue.": null, "[Scorple cackles]": null, "Captain Hob: Scorple!": null, "Scorple: This is so shitty!": null, "Surena: Scorple knows everything.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to look and say,": null, "Captain Hob: Obviously this does not extend, what I mean to say\u2014": null, "Rue: I fully understand, and please, speak plainly as\u2014": null, "Captain Hob: What I will say is this. A fish rots from the head.": null, "[dramatic percussive music]": null, "BINX: [in BINX\u2019s voice]\u00a0Wow, that's really profound.": null, "Captain Hob: And as such, as any true goblin would attest, the insult": null, "paid to our court time and time again from that rake, ruffian, and": null, "rapscallion, Prince Apollo is at the end of its long suffering!": null, "Scorple: Yeah!": null, "Captain Hob: If the Court of Wonder is to recover its lost station\u2014": null, "Scorple: Brap!": null, "Captain Hob: Then Prince Apollo will pay, and pay soon, for the insult": null, "he has already given!": null, "Rue: What insult is it?": null, "Captain Hob: The Viscountess Grabalba's honor will be avenged!": null, "Scorple: [squawks] Can I please be out of here?": null, "BINX: Yeah, I'm sorry.": null, "Scorple: Thank you! [screams]": null, "Squak: Did you hear that, cousin? There's yelling off in the distance!": null, "Surena: A tailor's in the middle of fucking nowhere.": null, "Brennan: I will say,": null, "Captain Hob: That is my opinion, freely given, of the Court of Wonder.": null, "Do you ask because you mean to... I do not believe that you are of that": null, "court. Not who you truly are.": null, "BINX: [in Gwyn\u2019s voice] You would be [changes to BINX\u2019s voice]": null, "absolutely correct.": null, "Surena: And I, like, change into\u2014because while you were pontificating, I": null, "was already starting to kind of shimmer a little bit.": null, "BINX: You're right, hi.": null, "Captain Hob: [sputtering] BINX\u00a0is Gwyn, and Gwyn is BINX!": null, "Andhera: I know! [laughs]": null, "Captain Hob: You knew?": null, "Andhera: Of course I knew, yeah. I figured it out yesterday.": null, "Captain Hob: Well, shit!": null, "Scorple: I knew. You dummy.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna eat Scorple.": null, "Captain Hob: They only live for like six hours.": null, "Andhera: The irony of that, because they were thinking about how hungry": null, "they were and they got eaten, is fascinating.": null, "Emily: [laughing] The idea that they only live six hours!": null, "Captain Hob: Yes, Left-tenant Gorebladder is actually a lineage of": null, "Gorebladders.": null, "Aabria: Yes, hereditary title.": null, "Captain Hob: Gorebladder's great great great great great great great": null, "grandfather started working for me like a couple days ago.": null, "Omar: A three hour death save, they got like 40 minutes. [laughs]": null, "[somber instrumental music]": null, "BINX: Yeah, so we all know. I'm very happy that you came, because the": null, "Court of Wonder has swallowed my court. I am the last one, as I said, as": null, "I stated, but that is not without conflict, and that is not without": null, "action. Fey, we don't die. We turn into other things. We get stuck, we": null, "get trapped. We become things in the material world, and I believe that": null, "the Court of Wonder is responsible for this. And again, not all Court of": null, "Wonder people, of course, but Apollo most especially, so if you are": null, "planning to take down Apollo, then count me right in, because I... I": null, "think that the Court of Wonder has done... Has done too much and has": null, "gotten away with it for too long.": null, "Brennan: I look at you.": null, "[Captain Hob chortling darkly]": null, "Surena: I start playing with my jack-in-the-box. I don't know what to": null, "do.": null, "Captain Hob: I can't imagine this meeting having gone any better. How": null, "exciting!": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to step towards you real quick and say,": null, "Captain Hob: What we need is this.": null, "[adventurous instrumental music]": null, "Brennan: I'll grab some tailor's cloth off a bench, spread it out on the": null, "thing, and go,": null, "Captain Hob: The Court of Wonder has set itself up to absorb the vast": null, "majority of the Bloom's magic. They have swept the Court of Sea Foam to": null, "the side, pulled much attention for themself. Apollo was trying with all": null, "his might to grab the Crystal Heart. There is\u2014": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to start sketching out Unseelie, Goblin, and I": null, "look up and say\u2014": null, "Surena: I'm going to grab some red string from the tailor's and I'm": null, "going to start connecting your guys.": null, "Captain Hob: Ms. Choppley.": null, "Captain Hob: I am of the opinion that your court shares common cause": null, "with my own.": null, "BINX: It's just me, so I absolutely do.": null, "Captain Hob: You can speak for a unanimous grouping of your court, yes.": null, "We have both been wronged in our own time by the Court of Wonder and": null, "perhaps are seen by certain factions within the fey realms as lesser": null, "fey.": null, "BINX: I mean, that's why I never... We never went to any Blooms. You": null, "know, it was a lot of bows and curtsies, and people don't spit when they": null, "curtsy, you know what I mean? There's things that are wrong here, and so": null, "we just\u2014we stayed at home.": null, "Brennan: I look at this schematic with the red yarn, and I'm going to": null, "look to Andhera, and I'm gonna stand up and just look over at Rue and": null, "say,": null, "Captain Hob: Master of Ceremonies, you have dwelt long with the Court of": null, "Wonder, and to all outward appearance, it is indeed your court, and we": null, "speak of it in a manner quite hostile. I would not suffer anyone near me": null, "to speak so of the Goblin Court in my presence, but I notice that you": null, "have remained stoic and silent. Has anything myself or Ms. Choppley said": null, "given you pause? If you seek satisfaction, I would understand, but I": null, "wish to know the manner of your silence.": null, "Rue: To be honest, Captain Hob, I am feeling a little bit torn at the": null, "moment.": null, "Oscar: And while Rue's saying this, they are deeply fighting emotions as": null, "they stare into Hob's beautiful eyes.": null, "Omar: Can I say that that's reflected in the cloud? It's changing form.": null, "Aabria: Ooh, yeah.": null, "Rue: Yes, I am part of the Court of Wonder. I speak and am a": null, "representative of the Court of Wonder. One might associate what I do at": null, "the Bloom with the Court of Wonder, but I have never felt one with them.": null, "I don't belong anywhere. The Court of Wonder is my home, but I'm never": null, "there. When I saw Gwyndolin at the Bloom, I should've recognized her,": null, "but I didn't, because I don't know anyone anymore. The reason why I am": null, "the Master of Ceremonies at the Bloom is to get away from a place that": null, "has hurt me deeply. And yet, I feel a sense of loyalty to the Court of": null, "Wonder. As you say these things, I want to implore, and you, the": null, "scathing things you've said about Apollo, I want to say, are you sure?": null, "What are you basing this on?": null, "BINX: I think that, you know, it is worth looking, right? I mean, even": null, "if it's not him, if he's just doing his own thing or whatever, then": null, "we'll know. But if he is pulling the strings\u2014": null, "Brennan: By the way, you're reading my mind right now. So when Rue": null, "describes a place that is your home that you never go, and a feeling of": null, "loyalty to a place you feel you don't belong, all Hob can think of is": null, "all those nights marching by the bonfire as far away from the goblin": null, "rumpus as he could get, and just thinking of what it means to have the": null, "only root you have not feed you, and all he wants to do in that moment": null, "is comfort Rue and say that everything they said was so deeply felt and": null, "understood, and the only thing Hob would disagree with that Rue said was": null, "that they don't belong anywhere, and that Hob knows that they do. All of": null, "that is surface, as Hob truly loses focus for that moment, and comes": null, "back and goes,": null, "Captain Hob: The matter at hand is this. Though you have spent long": null, "years far away from the court you call home, and though you are not": null, "truly Gwyndolin Thistle-hop, you two are the closest thing I as a goblin": null, "have as an insight into that court. Do I know these things of Prince": null, "Apollo? I wish I did. My victories on the battlefield bought our court a": null, "rare window of opportunity to rise in station, to enjoy the acclaim and": null, "honor enjoyed by other courts, and my victories were used to\u2026 to begin a": null, "suitorship with the Prince Apollo and the Viscountess Grabalba, though I": null, "will deny it if it is said in public.": null, "When that was called off, our opportunity was lost, and we have been": null, "looking for the person who was at cause to cancel that engagement. If": null, "either of you know who that was, and if it is not Prince Apollo, we will": null, "seek satisfaction from who actually did us wrong, but of course, the": null, "possibility remains that it was not one person, and that the entire": null, "affair was a charade from the beginning and was never meant to be an": null, "honest engagement. Do either of you know who could have been at cause?": null, "Or is our belief that there was one malefactor a delusion, and in fact": null, "there was never a hope of a goblin alliance with the Court of Wonder?": null, "Rue: Hob, I... You were the reason why Grabalba and Apollo were to wed?": null, "Captain Hob: Well, the victories over the Unseelie at the battle,": null, "well\u2014and, you know, no hard feelings.": null, "Andhera: It was a great fight.
