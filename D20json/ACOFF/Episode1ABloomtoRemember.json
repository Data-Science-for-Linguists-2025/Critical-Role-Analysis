We're still going.": null, "Lou: Nothing is precious today!": null, "Emily: I love it even more.": null, "Brennan: Wow!": null, "Lou: That was powerful.": null, "Aabria: Thank you.": null, "Emily: That was great.": null, "Aabria: I'm Aabria Iyengar, and with me inside this decorous dome are my": null, "pack of pixies. Say hi, pack of pixies!": null, "All: Hi, pack of pixies!": null, "Aabria: This is going to be a story about fashions, passions, and power": null, "struggles of archfey from a variety of courts and noble houses all": null, "across the fey realms as they come together to briefly celebrate a surge": null, "of magical power in their world known as the Bloom. If any of this is": null, "giving you Regency vibes, then yes, you are correct and you're in the": null, "right place.": null, "Lou: Bloom, okay.": null, "Emily: Okay, yeah, it's gonna be really weird for my barbarian": null, "character.": null, "Brennan: How do you spell that?": null, "Lou: It's Bloom. I think, well, how would we? Is it Blum like Blumhouse?": null, "Is this a horror thing?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes, yes. We're going full \u201cMidsommar\u201d.": null, "Lou: Yes, honestly? All right. I'm sorry.": null, "Aabria: No, you're good. So in order to get the flavor right for this": null, "story, we had to build upon what is already in front of us in 5th": null, "edition Dungeons & Dragons. So I have reached out to some of my favorite": null, "games that have mechanics specific to driving interpersonal conflict and": null, "confluence and the pushing of drama and melodrama. So when they pop up,": null, "you'll see them. Just know we're playing something a little hacked": null, "together and a little fun, but that's the fun of the story. But why": null, "don't I explain the first one to you right now?": null, "All of you have a chest in front of you, and though you can't see your": null, "own, you see that there's a row of seven stones on the front. These are": null, "no mere design. They're your reputation trackers. Now, in polite": null, "society, your reputation is everything, and the way you behave out in": null, "the world will affect how people see you, how you are able to get the": null, "things you want from others, and what you think of yourselves as you": null, "move through this space and make your choices. So at the end of every": null, "session, we'll assess, and you'll see at the top of the next game where": null, "your reputation tracker is, and I encourage all of you to play with": null, "these mechanics. As people's stars rise, they are more desirable to you.": null, "They're better connections, better friends, more desirable lovers.": null, "Emily: But maybe also someone we want to take down a peg?": null, "Aabria: Also that.": null, "Lou: Emily, what?": null, "Aabria: Axford gets the game. She came in knowing the assignment. And by": null, "that same token, as people's reputations begin to fade, that's not just": null, "incentive to avoid them, but they're vulnerable. Some of you are birds": null, "of prey. Never forget.": null, "Lou: Come on.": null, "Aabria: So do what you will.": null, "Oscar: Oh my gosh.": null, "Aabria: And follow your heart. And make good choices, or at least bad": null, "ones in private. Before we begin our tale of A Court of Fey & Flowers, I": null, "believe some formal introductions are in order, so let's begin with": null, "Surena.": null, "Surena: Hello, I'm Surena Marie, and I'll be playing [in higher voice]": null, "Gwyndolin Thistle-hop.": null, "Oscar: Hello, I'm Oscar Montoya, and my character's Delloso de la Rue,": null, "and my pronouns are they/them.": null, "Lou: [twisting upper body to turn his head back to the camera] Hello.": null, "I'm Lou Wilson and I'll be playing Lord Squak Airavis of the Lords of": null, "the Wing, pronouns he/him.": null, "Emily: [appearing from under the table] Hi, I'm Emily Axford and I'll be": null, "playing Lady Chirp Featherfowl, Countess of Cluckingham. She/her!": null, "Lou: Oh, I forgot. I'm also\u2014come back. I'm also a thing. I'm the Earl of": null, "Peckersburg.": null, "Emily: Hm, yeah. [to Brennan] It's your turn.": null, "Brennan: Hi. I didn't see you come in. My name's Brennan Lee Mulligan": null, "and I'm playing [in deeper voice] Captain K.P. Hob of the Goblin Court,": null, "[in normal voice] he/him.": null, "Omar: And I'm Omar Najam. I have no introduction. I have no cool thing": null, "that I'm doing, so. [holding arms up, pointer fingers touching thumb]": null, "Emily: That was nice, though. [copying the gesture] This is fun.": null, "Aabria: This is good.": null, "Omar: So let's just take a second.": null, "Aabria: This is great.": null, "Omar: I'm Omar Najam. I'm playing Andhera, he/they.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So why don't we get into it? All of this begins with": null, "the Bloom. Since the time before time, the fey realms have been the": null, "wellspring for magic that suffuses not just this realm, but all others.": null, "The flow of magic is natural here, and it waxes and wanes according to": null, "its own unknowable clock. But when magic surges here, the entire realm": null, "reacts in a riotous celebration of life. Verdancy, fertility, and the": null, "giddiness of abundance affect every living thing here, and the eye of": null, "the storm of fecundity is known as the Bloom. Fey of all stations have": null, "gathered to the Bloom to mix and mingle, to move through courts and": null, "spaces, and celebrate life and join together. And this is where we find": null, "ourselves now.": null, "Oscar: The party?": null, "Aabria: Before we get there, I think we need to meet our characters. So": null, "we're going to move across the fey realm, not in distance but in timbre,": null, "from the salty Sea Foam Court that is hosting this year's Bloom to a": null, "place of nigh darkness.": null, "[pensive piano music]": null, "It is, as ever, the Gloaming here in the Unseelie Court. [thunderstorm": null, "rumbling] You spot a lone figure moving through a massive, dark, marble": null, "loggia lit by a black fire torch flickering in the unceasing winds that": null, "both are and are of the Queen of Air and Darkness, the ruler here.": null, "Andhera, you are headed to your apartments within the palace to finalize": null, "your preparations to head to the Bloom. You know Advisor, your chaperone": null, "and advisor, is waiting for you there to lecture you one last time": null, "before you take off, on decorum and expectations and what will be asked": null, "and required of you during your travels away from your home court, the": null, "place you stand to inherit. But you pause and you look out into the": null, "heavy blue twilight and we see your face for the first time, so will you": null, "please describe yourself for me?": null, "Omar: Absolutely. Andhera is a tall, toned, young man.": null, "Oscar fans himself. Brennan tugs on his collar.": null, "Lou: I just got hungry.": null, "Emily: Fuck, I did too.": null, "Omar: The first thing you would notice about Andhera is their sort of": null, "tousled, curly hair that's sort of peppered and salted, and it falls": null, "over a dark purple face with just these piercing garnet eyes, and it's": null, "hard to read if it's specifically a scowl or a smile or somewhere in": null, "between, and their stature is perfect, absolutely regal looking out the": null, "window, and if you were to have any judgements about this individual,": null, "you might come to the conclusion that he definitely has muscle, but it's": null, "not muscle from actually doing lifting. It's completely visual.": null, "Aabria: Love that, love that.": null, "Omar: Completely useless gym muscle. Is what he's going for. He's in a": null, "robe that's sort of open a little bit.": null, "Oscar: Ooh!": null, "Oscar covers his mouth. Lou puts a hand on Oscar\u2019s shoulder.": null, "Omar: And just smolders.": null, "Aabria: Yes, good.": null, "Omar: Just constantly smoldering.": null, "Aabria: Yes, amazing. So as you look out, you hear the beginning of": null, "footsteps coming down this dark hallway, [footsteps echoing] and you see": null, "at the far end, the slender, sort of hunched form of Advisor coming in.": null, "Advisor: [clears throat] Young master, are you ill at ease? What are we": null, "looking at?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0He comes right over your shoulder and is just sort of looking.": null, "Andhera: Okay, that's very close.": null, "Advisor: What, is this uncomfortable for you?": null, "Andhera: It is incredibly uncomfortable, and you know that. Give me,": null, "like, just a couple feet, please.": null, "Aabria leans back.": null, "Andhera: Thank you.": null, "Aabria: Oh, he didn't do it. He just leans back a little bit.": null, "Andhera: Thank you, I will appreciate it that you give me a couple feet.": null, "Aabria: I need you to give me a persuasion check.": null, "Omar: Right, persuasion. I've got three different dice. This will be my": null, "diplomacy dice. All right, here we go.": null, "[players applauding politely]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0First roll!": null, "[Brennan laughing]": null, "Oscar: What?": null, "Surena: What is it?": null, "Emily: Yeah, baby!": null, "Omar: Now, total, it's a 3.": null, "Oscar: Oh no!": null, "Omar: With a plus 2, that's a 3.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, so we started with a 1?": null, "Oscar: Yo, seriously?": null, "Emily: We're starting off critical.": null, "Lou: If you all applaud for me, I'll stab you. I'll stab you on camera.": null, "Do not clap when I roll.": null, "Aabria: In defiance of your direct wishes, and truly physics, somehow": null, "Advisor closes the distance and is even nearer to you.": null, "Advisor: You're not in charge of the Unseelie Court yet, and I am here": null, "specifically to keep an eye on you, and that's what I will do.": null, "Aabria: And you feel just a little bit of his breath kind of float": null, "across your neck.": null, "Omar: Then I look to him and just really tense up my shoulders a bit,": null, "square out.": null, "Andhera: Actually, I wanted you to get closer, so actually what you did": null, "was what I\u2014I put you into a position where you'd do exactly what I did,": null, "Advisor.": null, "Advisor: Hm.": null, "Andhera: So are you not doing exactly what I said, in a way, if you": null, "think about it?": null, "Surena: [laughing] If you think about it!": null, "Andhera: Because I knew, because I played against\u2014the games we play, the": null, "strategy that I learned.": null, "Advisor: Yes.": null, "Andhera: I used against you.": null, "Advisor: I'm just going to jump in right here and remind you one more": null, "time that you need to double check all of your preparations, and if you": null, "need me to turn down any engagements and invitations that you've been": null, "given.": null, "[mysterious orchestral music]": null, "Advisor: I know you're excited to frolic in the flowers, but I would": null, "kindly remind you of who you represent. You and your sister, Suntar,": null, "need to do your best, because the queen herself will not be debasing her": null, "form with corporeality in order to make an appearance this Bloom.": null, "Omar: I turn back out and I clasp my hands behind me, which takes a": null, "second to kind of shove him out of the way.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, for sure.": null, "Omar: 'Cause he's right up in my business.": null, "Aabria: You just absolutely\u2014you kind of sack tap him and he tilts his": null, "head back.": null, "Omar: And I didn't mean to, and I want to communicate that a little bit,": null, "of, like, just shifting one inch over, and just kind of look out and": null, "laugh.": null, "Andhera:\u00a0I assure you, Advisor, the only thing that will be debased will": null, "be the\u2026 I, the\u2026": null, "Advisor: No, say it.": null, "Andhera: Expecta\u2014the\u2026": null, "Advisor: Mm-hm?": null, "Andhera: It's the\u2026": null, "Omar: Staring out.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera: Will be the low expec\u2014the low, yeah. [clears throat]": null, "Emily: This is the most perfect representation of a nat 1.": null, "Omar: Thank you, that was my nickname back in high school.": null, "Andhera:\u00a0The only thing that will be debased, Advisor, is your low": null, "expectations of me. My man.": null, "Omar: And I turn.": null, "Andhera: So, you know, put that in your pipe.": null, "Advisor: [sighs] Thank you for reminding me that I need to pack my pipe.": null, "I'm going to go finish getting ready, and I suggest you do the same.": null, "Andhera: Well, I will. Thank you for that advice.": null, "Advisor: Will you be bringing your beastie with you?": null, "Omar: Yes, he has a yeth hound, which, in case you don't\u2014": null, "Aabria: Yeah, for those\u2014yeah.": null, "Omar: For those who don't know, it's a dog with an old man's face.": null, "Lou and Oscar: Aw!": null, "Omar: No, I'm sorry, that's inaccurate.": null, "Emily: Omar, why did you introduce this?": null, "Omar: I'm sorry, that's actually inaccurate. It's a hound with an old": null, "man's head, is probably the better way to put it.": null, "[Aabria audibly shudders]": null, "Emily: So the whole head, not just the face.": null, "Lou: But in a cute, fun way?": null, "Omar: Oh.": null, "Lou: Like an adorable, fun way?": null, "Omar: Everything's up for interpretation, I suppose.": null, "Emily: What's the hair situation? I need to know.": null, "Omar: Like, a little bit.": null, "Emily: And the ear situation? Human?": null, "Omar: Still a little, we meet in the middle.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0We meet in the middle?": null, "Aabria: It's a terrible compromise on all fronts.": null, "Lou: I don't think this is adorable. The more he talks, it's not": null, "adorable.": null, "Oscar: So there's like a transition happening.": null, "Surena: It's like an ombre, yeah.": null, "Oscar: Ombre effect.": null, "Omar: You have a free photography editing program, and this was like,": null, "\u201cOh, this is how I can\u2014like, I'll erase half of this.\u201d": null, "Oscar: Okay.": null, "Omar: And just put it on top.": null, "Oscar: You got the free trial.": null, "Omar: The free trial.": null, "Oscar: Uh-huh, okay.": null, "Lou: I'm so glad our audience will have immediately just gotten a photo": null, "of it and be like, \"Oh, we get it.\"": null, "Aabria: We're in the space figuring out for ourselves. Yes, Advisor's": null, "going to turn on his heels and walk away, just sort of nodding as you": null, "mention bringing your hound, and he leaves you to your own devices to": null, "prepare however you see fit, but I will note that you were under the": null, "impression before that you would be the only one from the Unseelie Court": null, "besides Advisor going, and to find out that your sister, that sort of": null, "ray of light in an otherwise dark court, is going to be there, is new": null, "information.": null, "Omar: I wait for the footsteps to echo out.": null, "Aabria: Takes, like, a good two minutes.": null, "Omar: And I will wait those, mostly because it's that in between time": null, "where you're like, \u201cBut if I do anything, he'll know, because he can": null, "hear me, that I waited.\u201d": null, "Aabria: Yes.": null, "Omar: But he probably also knows that I'm standing exactly still, not": null, "making a noise, in order to not indicate that I am waiting. So finally,": null, "when I'm at my peace.": null, "Andhera: Damn. Damn, damn! Are you serious, man? Are you serious?": null, "She's\u2014dammit! Dammit!": null, "Omar: And I kick a piece of luggage.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera: Damn!": null, "Aabria: It tumbles into the ether.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera: Shit!": null, "Oscar: What was in that luggage?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah?": null, "Omar: Like, my fanciest clothes.": null, "Omar:\u00a0And I cast Dancing Lights to try to get it.": null, "Aabria: Amazing.": null, "Omar: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: What do your Dancing Lights look like?": null, "Omar: Imagine you can see the inside of a crystal without the external": null, "surface.": null, "Aabria: Oh.": null, "Omar: So everything\u2014when you peer into it, like, if you've ever done": null, "scrying or anything, that's what you're looking at, but there's no": null, "surface to it.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So yeah, this beautiful, prismatic light that is": null, "unbounded by geometry sparkles and shines, and you see a specific, dark": null, "gust of wind catch your luggage and sort of drop it back in front of": null, "you, and the scent on that wind lets you know that again, the Queen of": null, "Air and Darkness, who rarely debases herself to take a physical form, is": null, "here, and this is one of the kindest gestures you can imagine or": null, "remember in a long time, as she presents your luggage back to you.": null, "[thoughtful piano music]": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera: Thank you, mum, for that.": null, "Aabria: You feel the wind circle around you, and you're at the center of": null, "this small tornado, and it is a little suffocating, TBH. She is tousling": null, "your hair. There's the wind equivalent of cheeks being pinched, and all": null, "of it happening a little too close and a little too cold.": null, "Andhera: Okay, thank you. Thank you, mum. Thank you for all this. Thank": null, "you for getting my bag. I will make you proud, and you will see that I": null, "am the better child out of the two of us.": null, "Oscar: Not better child.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera: I will be your best boy, going forth.": null, "Aabria: From that, the wind leaves you and makes a little bit of a": null, "strange howling sound as it whips through the loggia that sounds": null, "somewhere between a sigh of resignation and maybe a bit of stifled": null, "laughter, and you're able to continue towards your apartments and get": null, "ready to leave. And we move from twilight to a midnight canopy full of": null, "stars. We move to a world away, the Court of Wonder.": null, "[upbeat orchestral music]": null, "The Court of Wonder is a joyous citadel of celebrations and the home and": null, "hub of those magics that are known by mortals to be miracles, the kind": null, "granted by fairies over tearful prayers in the dead of night, and we": null, "find Gwyndolin Thistle-hop. You are standing in a courtyard sort of": null, "choked with summer lilac, and you're watching dozens upon dozens of": null, "small, winged, lesser fey flitting back and forth, helping the massive": null, "contingent of the Court of Wonder prepare to take off and leave for the": null, "Bloom. And as we see you in this sort of serene step away from the": null, "busy-ness, would you please describe yourself?": null, "Surena: Sure. So Gwyndolin has bright pink, wavy hair that falls down to": null, "her shoulders. She wears the most ridiculous blue, flouncy dress that": null, "bobs as she walks. She has a large dandelion leaf flipping out of her": null, "hair and a beauty mark on the side of her face that is in the shape of a": null, "flower, that she calls a berry mark. She probably looks like a": null, "traditional fairy with her proportions, like Tinkerbell but in the real": null, "world, so it's kind of weird. You know what I mean?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, it's a little wrong.": null, "Surena: Her eyes are too big, her face is too wide. Yeah, it's like": null, "that.": null, "Aabria: You hold in your hand sort of your invitation via the court and": null, "the leaders of the Court of Wonder, the Chorus, inviting you and not": null, "your sister, the Blue Fairy, to this event. Where is she right now?": null, "Surena: I think Blue would most likely be in a fainting room or, you": null, "know, like those fancy rooms where it's a powder room, but it's just": null, "couches, you know what I mean?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Surena: That's where she hangs out.": null, "Surena: Yeah.": null, "[inquisitive instrumental music]": null, "Aabria: Let's talk a little bit about how you got your invitation,": null, "because Gwyndolin, who goes by her name and no official title, you're": null, "part of this court, though as people sort of walk by, the lesser fey": null, "know to bow and give deference to archfey as they walk. They're not": null, "necessarily doing that with you in this moment. So how did you get to": null, "score an invitation to the Bloom?": null, "Surena: Well, when you're friends with the people delivering": null, "invitations, things can get changed, and so, in that edit, my name was": null, "put on. [a sparkle chimes as Surena smiles]": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So we sort of cut from you in this moment looking down": null, "at your invitation and looking up at all of the preparations happening,": null, "and we cut back to your sister, the Blue Fairy of legend that turned": null, "Pinocchio into a real boy, as she is absolutely ripping your living": null, "room, your sitting room, to fucking bits in her fury at the slight of": null, "not being invited. [sounds of objects clattering and breaking] But": null, "that's a problem for another day.": null, "Surena: Mm-hm.": null, "Aabria: You're here now, and ready to go. And as you move through the": null, "courtyard towards the next steps to leaving, you get a little taste. It": null, "starts in the back of your throat and moves across your tongue to the": null, "very tip. It tastes like lemon, and you know what the taste of lemon": null, "means, and you know who that heralds, and Mika is reaching out to you,": null, "but is now the time for you to pick up this call? You've been tasting": null, "lemon probably once an hour.": null, "Surena: Once an hour?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, for the last two or three days.": null, "Surena: I'm going to find a corner somewhere. There's dark corners": null, "places, right?": null, "Aabria: Sure.": null, "Surena: The darkest of the corners.": null, "Aabria: Give me a Stealth check.": null, "Surena: Great.": null, "[players applauding elegantly]": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh, thank you. Wait, no, guys, don't clap!": null, "Lou: That's right, it's mean! It's mean to clap!": null, "Emily: Why?": null, "Lou: Because he got a nat 1.": null, "Emily: I know that.": null, "Surena: That was okay. A 20, but it's a dirty 20.": null, "Lou: Damn!": null, "Oscar: So?": null, "Surena: Thank you!": null, "Aabria: With a dirty 20, your body, your true essence, knows those": null, "liminal spaces and forgotten places, and you find one in shadow easily.": null, "Oscar: Where the music doesn't play.": null, "Lou: Where the sky's light does not shine.": null, "Emily: He can't reach.": null, "Surena: So in that liminal, dark space, I open my mind to communicate,": null, "but I don't\u2014it's just like, you know the spell Message, where it can": null, "only be, like, state your sentence?": null, "Aabria: Yeah.": null, "Surena: That's what I've opened.": null, "Aabria: Okay. You open it. On top of the lemon flavor that you've been": null, "swallowing, it was beginning towards the next step in that reach, that": null, "signaling. You begin to smell cookies full of cinnamon just on the edge": null, "of burning, and then it suddenly goes away as the channels open and you": null, "hear,": null, "Mika:\u00a0[tinny] Hello? Hello, are you there? Oh no, this is a\u2026 Oh shit,": null, "how many, I\u2026 How are you? Send the spell again. Plea\u2014?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it gets cut off.": null, "Surena: I panic, because it seems like they're having a thing, right?": null, "Surena: Fully having a thing. And I say,": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gwyndolin:\u00a0Give me till the next moon.": null, "Surena:\u00a0And it's just text that they would receive. They left me a": null, "voicemail and I texted back is essentially what happens.": null, "Brennan: Wow.": null, "Brennan: That's a statement in itself.": null, "Aabria: Once you send off that very brusque text, you feel across the": null, "bond with Mika disgruntled acceptance, but no sort of panic that would": null, "let you think that if you don't intervene in this moment, something dire": null, "would happen. And she tends to... It's obvious that she's in it right": null, "now, but that's kind of her energy.": null, "Aabria: So you're okay.": null, "Surena: Okay.": null, "Aabria: And she seems just sated enough to have heard from you at all": null, "that she lets it go, and you are left once again to your own devices.": null, "Surena: I'm going to get my things together and hurry on board.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Amazing.

Hob, what is foremost of mind? You": null, "know that your job here is one of a sentry, a sentinel watching out, so": null, "you are attenuated to the truly myriad rumors that fly about the courts,": null, "and you've had to pay attention not because you necessarily find them": null, "interesting, but because they are vital intel that will keep your": null, "charges alive. What interests you most in this moment?": null, "[contemplative string music]": null, "Brennan: Knowing that I will be accompanying Boil and Blemish, our most": null, "clever goblin nobility, to the Bloom, it remains ever on Captain Hob's": null, "mind that the military victories he won for the Goblin Court in their": null, "battles against the Unseelie afforded them the ability to enter into a": null, "very advantageous political marriage, and everything was set for the": null, "Princess Grabalba of the Goblin Court to be wed to Prince Apollo of the": null, "Court of Wonder, until, on the day of its announcement, before it was": null, "announced, everything was canceled.

She's not running or dancing or laughing, she's just": null, "burning them, and you know that those were a flower associated with": null, "Prince Apollo specifically, and you make a little bit of eye contact in": null, "that moment. She gives you a nod.": null, "Captain Hob: I will avenge your honor.": null, "Viscountess Grabalba: For ruin.": null, "Captain Hob: And rumpus!": null, "[Brennan imitating thudding blows]": null, "Captain Hob: Let me smash that barrel! I'm sorry! No, I wanted to!": null, "Aabria: And on and on it goes.": null, "[adventurous orchestral music]": null, "Aabria: So we move from there now to the scene of our tale, a massive": null, "tidal island just off of the coast of the Sea Foam Court's seemingly": null, "endless, sandy beaches.

You are the emissary of joy, a member of the Court of Wonder,": null, "but somehow separate from it, a little beyond it. You've been here for": null, "weeks, not just at the request of the nobility of the Court of Sea Foam,": null, "but you go where the energy leads you, and you were the first one to": null, "feel the Bloom coming on years ago, and you began laying the": null, "preparations down, putting the right pieces in place, and now, it's the": null, "day.": null, "Oscar: It's the day.": null, "Aabria: Everything's here. Everything's exactly the way you would have": null, "it to be, and therefore, perfect. Rue.": null, "Oscar: Mm!": null, "Aabria: So, you are looking out over this beautiful thing that you have": null, "wrought via your effort and artistic abilities, and you see a figure": null, "approaching you. It's a satyr with a little piebald deer coloration,": null, "almost galloping up to you. You can see her wide, terrified doe eyes": null, "from yards and yards away. This is your assistant Wuvvy, and as she": null, "gallops, her pure white curls bounce and reflect the beautiful summer": null, "sun, and we sort of follow her as she comes up to whisper something in": null, "your ear about something she's panicking over that is probably fine, and": null, "you take it with all of that good grace and we sort of follow the camera": null, "from her lips to your face. Delloso de la Rue, will you please describe": null, "yourself for us?": null, "[elegant orchestral music]": null, "Oscar: Okay, so Rue, as everyone calls me.": null, "Aabria: Of course.": null, "Oscar: Is decked out in theme in honor of the Sea Foam Court. They're": null, "wearing a gorgeous, light blue sort of bodysuit. Skintight, very Britney": null, "Spears in the \"Toxic\" video.": null, "Aabria: Yes!": null, "Oscar: Glittering, dazzling. Also, the ensemble is an ode to The Birth": null, "of Venus.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[unfurls fan] Yes, continue. This is good for me.": null, "Oscar: You think it's just a bodysuit, but oh no. On the bottom, you see": null, "that it is in fact a mermaid dress that rises up in a beautiful taffeta": null, "in the shape of the shell from the painting, you know?": null, "Aabria: [groans] Incredible.": null, "Oscar: Their skin is a beautiful light green color.": null, "Oscar: Their hair cascading down. Sea foam, of course.": null, "Aabria: Of course, of course.": null, "Oscar: Beautiful elfin ears, eyes correct.": null, "Oscar: Brows done, you know?": null, "Aabria: Look, let me be very clear, I did say this was a fashion game,": null, "so you are going to be making all persuasion checks for the rest of this": null, "session at advantage.": null, "Emily: Yeah!": null, "Aabria: We love a fit. Incredible. So yeah, Rue, Wuvvy is whispering in": null, "your ear and is just,": null, "Wuvvy: Every archfey that was supposed to be here from every court worth": null, "knowing has arrived, except...

I'm proud": null, "of you.": null, "Wuvvy: Thanks.": null, "Wuvvy: Okay.": null, "Rue: They will be late, and that is to be expected.

They can sort of\u2014": null, "Oscar: May I scope and see what is around me in terms of, is anything": null, "out of the ordinary? Is everything perfect?": null, "Aabria: Everything is perfect. The only thing you see\u2014it's not in flux,": null, "it's just being built up, is that at the southern end of the island, you": null, "see a hole is being bored into the seawall, and the tunnel that's going": null, "to lead out to tomorrow's hunt is being excavated, and that's right on": null, "time and right in line with your expectations and what should be": null, "happening now.": null, "Oscar: Okay, I look at the scenery and I take it all in. It's a very big": null, "moment for Rue.": null, "Oscar: And I smile, because it's here, it's happening. This is the": null, "Bloom. And I find my hands shaking a little. I get nervous, a little": null, "bit, because I want the Bloom to be the best there is. That's what I do.": null, "That's what I'm good at. But this one, there's something about it that,": null, "slightly, something feels special, more special than the other Blooms.": null, "And I take a deep breath, and I exhale like I told Wuvvy to do, and": null, "yeah, I slowly make my way to the destination.": null, "Aabria: Amazing, so we sort of follow you as you move down from the sort": null, "of edge of this palace at the top of the tier cake of this tidal island,": null, "and you pass, and everyone that sees you, especially everyone that's": null, "putting last touches on bouquets and ribbons and lights for later, give": null, "you not just a bow or a curtsy, but a bright, beaming smile to have been": null, "in your presence even for a moment, Rue.

You're not sure if this was an invitation that was": null, "originally meant for your sister, but you're here now, and you all are": null, "standing amongst maybe a dozen or so archfey. They've sort of started": null, "clumping together, and the four of you find yourselves standing close": null, "enough that the lawn itself begins to sprout, and it grows these": null, "beautifully ornate, wrought iron chairs, and it blossoms a massive": null, "mushroom for a table for you four to sit and talk to one another before": null, "whatever happens, happens.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Captain Hob: Allow me.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to, my arms go all the way down to my ankles.
