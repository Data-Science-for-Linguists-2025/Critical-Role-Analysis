It's like,": null, "Viola: This thick nasty air has been, is following us, in a way, it's": null, "pushing us out. We can't go back home, everyone is, is gone.": null, "Jasper: Where are we gonna live?": null, "Tula: Well, there was a time before our family found the burrow, and": null, "they made it long enough to find the Red Warren, and so we're gonna do": null, "what they did and we're gonna wait long enough to find another place to": null, "live. We're gonna go search in the woods and we'll just be together-": null, "Ava: Find other critters and kill them and take their home, yes. Very": null, "good, Tula.": null, "Tula: The way that we found the Red Warren is that it used to be rabbits": null, "that lived there, and your grandmother, when she was a very little girl,": null, "and her parents and grandparents found the Red Warren and they hunted": null, "the rabbits, and that was the first food they found in that place, and": null, "then that's where we all lived. So somewhere out there in the woods,": null, "here in the high ground, away from that bad air, we're gonna find a": null, "place just like that and we're gonna be able to make it into a home,": null, "okay?": null, "Lila: But how do we know that where we go next isn't gonna have bad, bad": null, "dust everywhere and Blue and monsters and things that everybody talks": null, "about but doesn't say what it is?": null, "Tula: Well, we're just gonna have to be very careful, and we're gonna": null, "have to look hard and try to find a place that's safe.": null, "Thorn: I do think there is things that we can do. I think I've seen": null, "these creatures, this force that you spied from the tree before, and,": null, "well, I've seen things that can affect these creatures. It is possible": null, "that we could maybe even once drive them out. That was the whole basis": null, "of my, of the Lukura, (laughs) what remains of it. But I see no reason": null, "why we couldn't do the same.": null, "Viola: Thorn, I'm just, I'm confused because we can't even touch it. How": null, "do we fight something we can't touch?": null, "Tula: The air, no, the lightning.": null, "Rashawn: I don't know if Viola's ever seen lightning.": null, "Aabria: Give me an arcana check.": null, "Rashawn: 12.": null, "Aabria: Thorn has told you the story of this, but you've never seen the": null, "conditions that he experienced on that night, lightning, not coming down": null, "from the sky, but up from the ground and between creatures of": null, "unfathomable size. You've seen sparks and bits of lightning when Thorn": null, "truly focuses, moments of brilliance that have inspired a lot of the": null, "worship that's happened in and around him and the cult, but the scale of": null, "the thing that you saw from the top of the tree, you, like, trying to": null, "figure out, like, you can't fathom the size of the thing that's coming.": null, "So it's sort of, isn't really lining up with what he's saying.": null, "Rashawn: Hmm. Viola I guess is kind of falling into herself. Like, she's": null, "a little scared because this is, it was a story at first, and now it's": null, "tangible, or intangible, and that is very confusing to her. So I guess": null, "she looks to her mother for any,": null, "Viola: Mama, I'm scared.": null, "Ava: Well, that's perfectly normal.": null, "Viola: Great advice. (laughs) (group laughs) Good talking to you, Mama.": null, "Great.": null, "Ava: Well, well, we just gotta push on through.": null, "Thorn: But I understand why you're scared. I understand why we're all": null, "scared, but in the same way that we've seen these creatures, I have seen": null, "them be repelled. I've seen them be pushed back by this force, this": null, "lightning, this magic, and all of us possess it in some way, shape, or": null, "form. Perhaps it's not lightning, but it's still some brilliance that": null, "you all possess.": null, "Tula: How many of these monsters have you repelled?": null, "Thorn: That's an interesting question. (chuckles nervously)": null, "Viola: It's okay, you can tell 'em, we're all family here.": null, "Ava: That's right, son, you tell us how many monsters that you've": null, "repelled.": null, "Thorn: One, probably, kind of.": null, "Olliver: There was, like, another one there, I think. There was, like,": null, "two.": null, "Thorn: Yeah, there were probably, yeah, probably two. Probably two.": null, "Viola: Two.": null, "Thorn:\u00a0(whisper) Thank you, Olliver.": null, "Olliver:\u00a0(whisper) Yeah.": null, "Tula: So you have the power to repel these monsters.": null, "Thorn: I'm not saying that, well, the whole point of the Lukura was that": null, "we were to (sighs) try and ascend towards this power, keep training,": null, "getting better, getting stronger.": null, "Tula: It's a goal, it's an aspiration.": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Tula: All right, so I think that that's a very worthy aspiration, and": null, "that before that, we will probably have to find shelter from rain. We": null, "will have to find food so that we do not go hungry, and there are a": null, "number of things that are very dangerous that are not creatures or": null, "monsters or the Blue. There are some very simple things that are": null, "dangerous, like going cold and going hungry, and we need to find shelter": null, "and safety.": null, "Teedles: Mrs. Tula, that is what, before we got to where we were camped,": null, "that's what we did, we are good.": null, "Thorn: We were quite good at it, yeah. (laughs)": null, "Teedles:\u00a0At surviving-": null, "Thorn: We moved around and we would find shelter where needed and food": null, "where we needed-": null, "Tula: I didn't mean to insinuate that you weren't, Thorn-": null, "Teedles:\u00a0No, not at all.": null, "Tula: I just-": null, "Teedles: I'm trying to be reassuring, I don't know how to, (whisper) is": null, "this working?": null, "Thorn: (whisper) This is great.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0This is great.": null, "Thorn: I think everyone's just- (group chattering)": null, "Tula: If it's all right with you, Thorn, I think that the best thing for": null, "the cause is for us to be safe.": null, "Thorn: Absolutely.": null, "Tula: And so if we know of any place where these monsters are not that": null, "we can recover and get on our feet and make sure that the children are": null, "safe and that they have a place to rest, then that is of the highest": null, "priority, and I think we're all in agreement on that.": null, "Thorn: Yes, I couldn't agree more. It was merely trying to provide a": null, "sense of hope after such a tragic encounter, but, yes, personally, I": null, "suggest we keep moving up to higher ground. I think the further away we": null, "can get from what's just happened, the better. But I open up to the": null, "group, and we have an excellent tracker to help us get to that higher": null, "ground.": null, "Siobhan: I'm, like, sitting in a tree.

(group laughs)": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Called \"Divine Sense,\" and it lets me-": null, "Aabria: Oh, that's so interesting.": null, "Brennan: And it lets me detect celestials, fiends, and undead, but I": null, "can't help but notice that we're at a setting that probably doesn't have": null, "those.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Correct.": null, "Brennan: Can I use divine sense to detect my children?": null, "(group laughs)": null, "Aabria: I think maybe Jaysohn counts as a fiend, like a little bit.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Hellions.": null, "Izzy: Can I just be with him, like, we're just up in a tree?": null, "Siobhan: Up in a tree,": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Give me a stealth check.": null, "Siobhan: just, like, doing cat's cradles.": null, "Izzy: Stealth? 12.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. Yeah, you're sitting in the knot of a tree. What does it": null, "look like as Tula activates this ability? (slow ambient music)": null, "Lila: Jaysohn's right here.": null, "Tula: Thank you, sweetie.": null, "Brennan: It looks like that. (group laughs)": null, "Aabria: Thank you so much, a moment killer, we fucking love it. (group": null, "laughs)": null, "Jaysohn: I'm right here.": null, "Tula: Sweethearts, do you want to come down from the tree? We're gonna": null, "talk about where we want to go next.": null, "Jaysohn: Not really.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Oh. (laughs)": null, "Ava: Come on down.": null, "Lila: I think we should be up in the tree.": null, "Jaysohn: We're okay being up in the tree, thank you.": null, "Lila: I think we should all live up in the tree.": null, "Jaysohn: Maybe we should live up in the tree-": null, "Ava: Control your children.": null, "Lila: We don't need-": null, "Jaysohn: It's kind of nice up here.": null, "Lila: We're just sort of saying how we feel-": null, "Jaysohn: I think a bird used to live up here. (Aabria laughs)": null, "Tula: A bird used to live up there?": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna go up in the tree with my kids.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Sure, sure, sure.": null, "Lila: (whisper) Mom.": null, "Tula: Yeah?": null, "Lila: Is Thorn bad? (light, plucking string music)": null, "Tula: No, Thorn's not bad.": null, "Jaysohn: (whisper) Are you sure?": null, "Tula: No, Thorn is not bad, Thorn is trying to help. And sometimes when": null, "people try to help, they set very lofty goals. That's all, so unless, is": null, "there are hole big enough in the tree that you found that could fit all": null, "of us and food and moss?": null, "Jaysohn: Oh.": null, "Lila: I don't know, but I feel like we shouldn't be on the ground": null, "because the ground is where everybody dies.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Right.": null, "Tula: Unfortunately, sweetie, there are owls and birds in the forest": null, "that can come up into the trees. So the ground's not safe, but the trees": null, "are not a permanent answer.": null, "Lila: Can we eat birds?": null, "Tula: It's hard to eat birds, hard to catch birds.": null, "Jaysohn: I think I could do it.": null, "Lila: Jaysohn's really fast.": null, "Tula: Well, then let's go find some bird nests. I don't see any here.": null, "Let's head back down and join the rest of the family.": null, "Lila: They might have eggs.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, (gasps) I love eggs.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Me too.": null, "Tula: Let's go find some eggs, come on.": null, "Lila: Mom?": null, "Tula:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Lila: I've been trying to figure out what's going on for, like, a really": null, "long time, and it finally happened, like, I thought that something": null, "really bad was gonna happen, and it did, and I wasn't able to figure out": null, "what happened, and nobody says whatever happened, except our dad is": null, "dead, but, like, all of the adults say all the time that, like, a big": null, "thing is gonna happen, or did happen all the time, and it's sort of the-": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, they did say that.": null, "Lila: The most frustrating thing ever, and it sort of makes me feel": null, "like, it hurts to be awake because it's all I think about, and there are": null, "never any answers.": null, "Jaysohn: She doesn't really sleep.": null, "Lila: And the people just say, like, things-": null, "Jaysohn: I don't think she really sleeps.": null, "Lila: People say \"things\", \"creatures\", \"Blue\", \"monsters\", and it's": null, "like, oh, my God.": null, "Jaysohn: She really wants to know. She talks about it all the time.": null, "Lila: Just say what's going on. And then it's, like, finally the bad": null, "thing comes, and it's just the air, it's not even, like, a monster or": null, "something that you can see-": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah, it's, like, it shouldn't be that scary-": null, "Lila: That, like, kills you, it's just air, and then it's like, I listen": null, "to what everybody's saying all the time, but it just feels like actually": null, "none of the adults even know what they're talking about. It's like, oh,": null, "nobody has actually ever seen it, except for maybe Dad, and he's dead.": null, "Jaysohn: He's so dead.": null, "Lila: So it's, (frustrated stammers) you know, and-": null, "Tula: Sweetie, breathe, breathe. Can you take a deep breath? Can you": null, "take a deep breath in through your nose? One long breath in through your": null, "nose, (deep breath in) and then out through your mouth. (tight breath": null, "out) Not that tight, a little bit softer than that. (inhales) (big": null, "exhale) That's all, great.": null, "Lila: (whisper) Your breath smells so bad.": null, "Jaysohn: (whisper) Shut up!": null, "Tula: Don't tell your sister to shut up.": null, "Jaysohn: (silently) Shut up!": null, "Tula: Let's go- (Crew laughs from offset) Let's all go back down, and": null, "tonight, you are owed a conversation about all these things. So we'll": null, "talk about them tonight, okay? But let's go, it's not safe where we are": null, "right now.": null, "Aabria: Lila, do you trust everything your mother just told you?": null, "Izzy: Implicitly. (group laughs)": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Rashawn: Whoa.": null, "Erika: Meanwhile, down on the ground, I'm, like, real close to Thorn.": null, "I'm gonna do an insight check.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Looking for what?": null, "Siobhan: Just having your mother-in-law just-": null, "Erika: Doesn't matter, it's an eight, it's nothing.": null, "Viola: Mama's just trying to sniff you out.": null, "Erika: Yeah, I am literally. (sniffs)": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Thorn: There you go.": null, "Teedles: Hi, miss-": null, "Ava: Shh!": null, "Thorn: Shh, definitely-": null, "Teedles: Interesting.": null, "Thorn: Definitely don't.": null, "Teedles: Yeah, she's very close to you, and it's very weird.": null, "Thorn: I know, it's fine. Don't worry about it.": null, "Teedles: I'm feeling a way-": null, "Thorn: I'll let you know, I'll let you know.": null, "Viola: (silently) It's okay, she gets close.": null, "Teedles: Yeah, but, I mean.": null, "Thorn: Do you, you know what that was.": null, "Ava: I don't know if I know what that was, but I know about the": null, "lightning, and I know that you deeply care about my daughter. So right": null, "now, I'm going to leave the very precarious fate of this remainder of": null, "the Warren in your hands.": null, "Thorn: Mm-hmm.": null, "Ava: (intense whisper) Don't fuck it up.": null, "Thorn: Don't plan on it.": null, "(group laughs) (Jasper sighs) (group laughs)": null, "Viola: That's honestly her being really loving and inviting, you know.": null, "Thorn: I really think I made a breakthrough with your mother. That was": null, "amazing, did you see that?": null, "Viola: I did see it.": null, "Thorn:\u00a0Yeah, okay, she-": null, "Viola: But I've also-": null, "Thorn: She said the word trust-": null, "Viola:\u00a0The word trust, but also-": null, "Thorn: She said the word trust.": null, "Teedles: Right, but you didn't, I'm sorry, I'm not in this conversation.": null, "Thorn: It's okay, come in.": null, "Aabria: Olliver, no, Olliver's like,": null, "Olliver: Me and Teedles are gonna, we're just gonna go around-": null, "Erika: Go around to the other, see the rest of the, see the rest of the": null, "stoats that are still around.": null, "Aabria: Just two.": null, "Erika: Oh that's just two, everybody else-": null, "Siobhan: Did the badger make it out?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you guys saw the badger sprinting off in a direction.": null, "Ava: All right, all right, and the two of you.": null, "Teedles: Hi.": null, "Ava:\u00a0Hi.": null, "Ava: Toodles.": null, "Teedles: (offended) Mm-mm.": null, "Ava: Well.": null, "Teedles: You can make the effort.

(group laughs)": null, "Aabria: Do you want to? It will be obvious.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, I'm like, \"Hmm.\"": null, "Aabria: Do it.": null, "Erika: Yeah. (laughs)": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Yeah, yeah.": null, "Erika: 28.": null, "Izzy: You shit yourself.": null, "Erika: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Teedles looks from you and at you, and there is a note, there's": null, "no roll for this, of utter betrayal, that she was trying to stand up for": null, "you, and looks back. At a 28, you see her, like, her ears pin back, and": null, "she steps back and slides behind Olliver, her partner.": null, "Teedles: Okay.": null, "Ava: You too, Gulliver.": null, "Olliver: You are very good at keeping your family alive in a hole in the": null, "ground, and we survived for as long as we did out here, but go ahead.": null, "Aabria: And you see that, like, in the sort of dynamic that is forming,": null, "the two people that were closest with you are now sort of stepping out": null, "and away, and are very much putting themselves on the fringe of this": null, "group and absolutely not making eye contact with Ava. She is terrifying.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0If I can, I'll sidle up to the two of them.": null, "Thorn: I realize this is all extremely strange, and I owe you both an": null, "apology.": null, "Teedles: For what?": null, "Thorn: You've been nothing but loyal, and I'm asking you to do something": null, "which feels utterly against everything that we have used to survive this": null, "entire time, and I completely understand. I am trying so desperately to": null, "keep us all together, to not cause rifts, and they are, they have a": null, "completely different understanding and see the world so differently to": null, "us that if we lead with our full selves and show every card all at once,": null, "they'll bolt, they'll run, and people will die. And I've already been": null, "responsible for the death of so many, and I can't let that happen again,": null, "and I appreciate that I've hurt you, and that you have suffered through": null, "great loss, but I need you now more than ever, not to be my beacons, but": null, "to be there for me, and I will do everything I can to keep everyone here": null, "safe.": null, "Aabria: Olliver's gonna reach out and kind of grab you by the back of": null, "your neck and, like, lean his forehead into yours.": null, "Olliver: They, if they knew what we saw that night, I don't care if a": null, "mom is mean to you. That old woman has seen some shit. We get it and we": null, "respect it, but if they think that all of the knowledge that they need": null, "to survive will live and die within their little family-": null, "Thorn: I know all of this, but the thing is, we can't show them. If we": null, "could-": null, "Olliver: Why?": null, "Thorn:\u00a0How, how do you-": null, "Olliver: Every time you've showed them, (sighs) people follow you, they": null, "listen to you. How can you not convince the people that you think are": null, "your family of a truth that dozens of stoats and creatures that we": null, "couldn't even communicate with understood? That's you doubting who you": null, "are, and we can't convince you of that. But sure, whatever it takes.": null, "We're gonna go scout. We'll let you know if we see anything.": null, "Thorn: Don't go far.": null, "Olliver: Only as far as we have to.": null, "Thorn: I mean it, I can't lose anyone else, least of all you two.": null, "Jasper: And I'll, head together,": null, "Thorn: Brighter than the sun, swifter than the wind.": null, "Teedles: Swifter than the wind.": null, "Jasper: And I'll give Teedles Guidance. I felt like Teedles is the one": null, "that's tearing the most, so.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, Teedles just pooped a little bit.
