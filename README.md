# Critical-Role-Analysis
Final project by Ashley Bakaitus.<br> 
Discourse analysis of D&amp;D podcasts Critical Role and Dimension20<br>
April 2025, aeb145@pitt.edu

This research project has the goal of examining the data from transcripts of two different D&D podcasts, Critical Role and Dimension 20. Based on what I found to be the most informative features, like speech turns, sentence length, and word count, is there a significant difference between a man Dungeon Master (CR) and a woman Dungeon Master (D20)?
Additionally, investigating the differences proportionally between players by gender and players/DM across all informative features as well as the presence and strength of hedging and jargon.
What does a D&D liveplay campaign look like in speech data? Who is contributing more? Are there any significant differences between the two podcasts' players and DMs?

The data used in this project was extracted from videos, compiled, and edited primarily by fans and partially by a professional transcription serivce (for subtitles).
Critical Role transcripts sourced from [Kryogenix](https://www.kryogenix.org/crsearch/html/index.html#c2) and created by CRTranscript, a fan-led transcription service, Critical Role, and compiled by Stuart Langridge.<br>
Dimension 20 transcripts sourced from the [fandom wiki](https://dimension20.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_Transcripts) with thanks to users: OliverC, Rachel S., Claire B., gluegunshots, Mer, Kyber Bonsai, tevildo, solys, Tillie the Paladin, kindlestuck, and Ethan Belanger.
