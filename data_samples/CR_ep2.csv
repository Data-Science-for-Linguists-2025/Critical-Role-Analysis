182527,0,MATT,"And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons. ",2,00:00:00,,
182528,1,TRAVIS,Dungeons & Dragons! ,2,00:00:05,,
182529,2,MATT,"Or that. We also do that, I guess. ",2,00:00:08,,
182530,3,TALIESIN,That's the same embarrassment that you feel about us; the way we're feeling about you now. ,2,00:00:10,,
182531,4,MATT,What the fuck was that?! ,2,00:00:13,,
182532,5,SAM,Where we play Dungeons & Dragons! ,2,00:00:15,,
182533,6,MATT,"Oh my god. Welcome. We're already loopy, what could possibly go wrong? So yes, welcome! Before we jump into tonight's game, we have some announcements to get through real fast so hold tight for just a moment. First and foremost, continuing tonight's sponsorship with our friends at D&D Beyond. Our now long-term partner. We're super excited to be working with them for the foreseeable future for the time being with the show. Sam, you have some words, I believe. ",2,00:00:18,,
182534,7,SAM,"To plug our good friends at D&D Beyond, I need my fellow castmates to help me. Can we practice? Can you all say, ""Boo""? ",2,00:00:44,,
182535,8,ALL,Boo! ,2,00:00:51,,
182536,9,SAM,"Can you all say, ""Yay""? ",2,00:00:53,,
182537,10,ALL,Yay! ,2,00:00:54,,

182546,19,SAM,"Just kidding, he is! ",2,00:01:23,,
182547,20,ALL,Yay! ,2,00:01:24,,
182548,21,SAM,I have to use both the boo and the yay or else it doesn't make sense. He can do cool stuff like activate Critical Role content in his character builder and create a blood hunter. ,2,00:01:26,,
182549,22,ALL,Yay! ,2,00:01:39,,
182550,23,SAM,And do you think they charge an arm and a leg? ,2,00:01:40,,

182557,30,ALL,Boo! ,2,00:02:02,,
182558,31,SAM,"No, is that D-N-D Beyond? ",2,00:02:04,,
182559,32,ALL,Yay! ,2,00:02:07,,
182560,33,SAM,And this spot was written by Sam Riegel. ,2,00:02:08,,
182561,34,ALL,Boo! ,2,00:02:10,,(laughter) 
182562,35,MATT,"Thank you so much, Sam. And thank you, D&D Beyond, for being our partners for this new campaign. ",2,00:02:15,,
182563,36,LAURA,"Marisha, you yay'ed, good for you! ",2,00:02:23,,
182564,37,MARISHA,"I did! It was a little complacent, but I yay'ed. I gave him one. ",2,00:02:25,,
182565,38,MATT,"Oh man. Talks Machina, of course, our after talk show about this episode will be on next Tuesday, as it is every Tuesday, after the show at 7:00pm Pacific here on Twitch and Project Alpha, with our host Brian W. Foster.  I always burp when I say his name. I wonder what that says about him. I don't know why. ",2,00:02:30,,(burp)
182566,39,LAURA,It's that cabbage smell. ,2,00:02:52,,
182567,40,MATT,"It's the cabbage. So check that out. Merch, Laura. ",2,00:02:53,,
182568,41,LAURA,"So, you know, we talked about those posters last week. They're still in the store on pre-order. Some of them are getting shipped out right now, so you should be getting them soon. ",2,00:02:57,,
182569,42,ALL,Yay! ,2,00:03:12,,
182570,43,LAURA,"We're going to leave them on pre-order until Monday night, so if you're watching this on YouTube after it's been aired live, you've got until midnight to put in that order. ",2,00:03:14,,
182571,44,ALL,Yay. ,2,00:03:23,,
182572,45,LAURA,More will be coming soon if those sell out. You know how it goes. ,2,00:03:25,,
182573,46,MATT,"Once again, we are firmly in support of our longtime charity partners, 826LA. They do awesome work teaching creative writing classes for children who normally wouldn't have the opportunity to get involved. They do phenomenal work. I recommend that you research them and if you can, either help with a donation or actually, you can donate your time as well to help teach and be part of the program if one is near you. Go check it out. ",2,00:03:49,,
182574,47,MARISHA,"We were talking to one of the heads at 826LA over the break, Joel, and he was saying that they would love to do D&D, but no one on their staff knows how to DM or do D&D. So if there's an 826 in your area, and you're like, ""I know, I'll start a D&D club,"" I'm sure they'll be open to it, just go talk to them and go teach kids D&D! ",2,00:04:45,,
182575,48,MATT,Yeah. Run a game for a bunch of cool teenagers and show them how awesome this game is. ,2,00:05:06,,
182576,49,MARISHA,Or cool eight-year-olds who are equally as amazing. ,2,00:05:11,,
182577,50,SAM,Or dorky eight-year-olds or teenagers. ,2,00:05:14,,
182578,51,MATT,"Those are the same, Sam. ",2,00:05:16,,
182579,52,MARISHA,Nerd is chic now. ,2,00:05:18,,
182580,53,MATT,"All right, cool! Appearances. Laura and Travis will be at Emerald City Comic Con in Seattle, March 2nd to the 4th. If you're up in that area, go over and say hi to them. I will be at Lexington Comic and Toy Con in Lexington, Kentucky March 9th to the 11th. As well as Otafest in Calgary up in Canada, May 18th to the 20th, and Akon in Texas, June 7th to the 10th. ",2,00:05:20,,
182581,54,SAM,Calgary is like the Kentucky of Canada. ,2,00:05:50,,
182582,55,LAURA,Is it? ,2,00:05:53,,
182583,56,SAM,I don't know. ,2,00:05:55,,
182584,57,MARISHA,I'll take that as a compliment. ,2,00:05:56,,
182585,58,LIAM,"I am also going to Bak-Anime, not to be confused with SacAnime, on February 3rd and 4th. ",2,00:05:58,,
182586,59,TRAVIS,"How do you spell that, B-A-K? ",2,00:06:05,,
182587,60,LIAM,"B-A-K, that's real soon. So I'll be there. ",2,00:06:07,,
182588,61,MATT,Beautiful. And I believe-- ,2,00:06:09,,
182589,62,LIAM,Comic book. ,2,00:06:13,,
182590,63,MATT,"Issue four on the 24th, I believe it is? ",2,00:06:20,,
182591,64,TALIESIN,By far the most fourth of all of these books. It's easily the most fourth. ,2,00:06:23,,
182592,65,TRAVIS,Like the blue hair. ,2,00:06:29,,
182593,66,TALIESIN,"Thank you, this is new. Just went for this, it's going to slowly darken over time. ",2,00:06:31,,
182594,67,MATT,Into pure shadow. ,2,00:06:35,,
182595,68,TALIESIN,"It's going to be keyframed and photoshopped, I'm aware. ",2,00:06:37,,
182596,69,MATT,"The invitation is there, folks. Screencap and photoshop away. ",2,00:06:43,,
182597,70,TALIESIN,I've already been told that's it's going to happen. ,2,00:06:47,,
182598,71,MATT,"And welcome back. Last we left off, our slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to have their stories intertwine in the city of Trostenwald, on the southern reaches of western Wynandir on the continent of Wildemount. Here we had Nott and Caleb who had been traveling southward coming and meeting, in the center of the tavern, the Nestled Nook Inn, with Jester, Beauregard, and Fjord. They were invited to a nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their performance later that evening, in which they met Yasha and Molly. After swapping some stories, earning and losing some gold, they began to gather at the outskirts of the Ustaloch, the lake right on the eastern edge of Trostenwald, for the first opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop Carnival of Curiosities. ",2,00:08:26,,
182599,72,TALIESIN,Traveling Carnival of Curiosities. ,2,00:09:25,,
182600,73,MATT,"Upon entering the tent, they saw a number of performances. However, during a musical performance by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this mysterious, magically enchanting experience, a member of the audience rose up and began to transform into a terrible undead creature that began to lash out, killing another member of the audience, who then began to become one of these same creatures. You all, grabbing your weapons from Yasha, who had been keeping them stashed away, leapt into the fray, slaughtered both of these terrible beasts, just in time for the crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell happened. After information had been gathered of who was immediately available and responsible for this carnival, Gustav, Bo the Breaker, and Molly were marked to be arrested. One of the guards was escorted outside of the tent by Yasha, who was going to show him where this young dwarven girl was currently resting, and upon being led astray to the wrong tent, she just ran into the distant hills and vanished. And that is where we left off. ",2,00:09:27,,
182601,74,SAM,So we're still at the carnival? ,2,00:10:36,,
182602,75,MATT,You're still in the tent. ,2,00:10:39,,
182603,76,LIAM,With crownsguard? ,2,00:10:40,,
182604,77,MATT,"With the crownsguard and with Watchmaster Jossyd. The crownsguard that had left naught but a moment before comes rushing in, his breath huffing, sweat dripping from his brow, his eyes wild. He goes, ""Watchmaster! The big woman is gone! She's gone!"" The Watchmaster turns to him and says, ""You three, go with him. Search for her."" They all immediately run out back out the performer's flap and he turns to the rest of you in the group, ""Shackle and drag those three down to the stockade."" About five guards approach and begin to press Gustav, Bo, and Molly to the ground and begin to put chains and shackles on them. ",2,00:10:42,,
182605,78,TALIESIN,I'd like to make a counteroffer? ,2,00:11:28,,
182606,79,MATT,"He's in mid-speech, ""The rest of you keep an eye on the performers here. Ask around, see what you can find. As for the others, don't go far."" ",2,00:11:32,,
182607,80,LAURA,"The innocent patrons, you mean? ",2,00:11:48,,
182608,81,MATT,"You will be questioned, and when this investigation is completed, regardless of how long it may take, you are not to leave Trostenwald."" ",2,00:11:50,,
182609,82,LIAM,"If I could just contribute one word, the 40 or so people who are outside and the rest of us will vouch for this one, the colorful one. He saved many people's lives. Don't take my word for it. There's everyone outside. ",2,00:12:09,,
182610,83,MATT,"All the rest of the crownsguard glance to each other, he goes, ""Well, unfortunately, that is not for me to decide. The Lawmaster would have to be appealed to. If you wish to come with us, we can bring you along with us to the stockade and you can speak with her. Then, perhaps, she may grant you leniency, but I can give you no guarantee."" ",2,00:12:24,,
182611,84,MARISHA,Why don't you just question us right now? I'm confused on why you don't just do that now. ,2,00:12:44,,
182612,85,MATT,"""Well, we could do that instead. We'll have you arrested, put you in the stockade as we question the rest of you."" ",2,00:12:51,,
182613,86,LAURA,"No, let's go to the stockade. ",2,00:12:59,,
182614,87,TRAVIS,"Yeah, we'll all be in one place. ",2,00:13:01,,
182615,88,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,00:13:03,,
182616,89,MARISHA,Jails are not my favored terrain. Just want to point that out. Not this go-around. No. ,2,00:13:05,,
182617,90,TRAVIS,Good to know. ,2,00:13:12,,
182618,91,LAURA,I would have guessed that about you. ,2,00:13:14,,
182619,92,MARISHA,Not really comfortable with that. ,2,00:13:16,,
182620,93,MATT,"Watch over the performers. Make sure nobody leaves. Come if you wish. Otherwise, we'll be in touch."" The Watchmaster gathers alongside the other five crownsguard, lifting up the shackles of the three that had been arrested and begin to drag them outside of the tent and into the night air. ",2,00:13:20,,
182621,94,LIAM,I send Frumpkin to follow. ,2,00:13:41,,
182622,95,MATT,Okay. ,2,00:13:42,,
182623,96,MARISHA,Can I double back into the performance area and see if I can find that little girl that they're looking for? Before they do? ,2,00:13:44,,
182624,97,MATT,"You may, if you want to. So you send Frumpkin just to follow them. You guys are staying behind, then? ",2,00:13:51,,
182625,98,TRAVIS,Are there three regular crownsguard that are going with Molly? Or is the Watchmaster going with them as well? ,2,00:13:56,,
182626,99,MATT,"The Watchmaster is going with them, or at least he's exiting the tent with them. It looks like there are five crownsguard attending the three of them that are shackled. ",2,00:14:03,,
182627,100,TRAVIS,I'll go out the front exit of the tent just to see if the Watchmaster goes with Molly. ,2,00:14:08,,
182628,101,MATT,Okay. ,2,00:14:13,,
182629,102,LAURA,I'll follow Fjord. ,2,00:14:14,,
182630,103,MATT,"Anybody with them? Currently, it's you two and Frumpkin. ",2,00:14:16,,
182631,104,SAM,"Are we going with them or not? Should we stay here? This is not our affair, right? ",2,00:14:22,,
182632,105,LIAM,I don't know. I'm having second thoughts about being here at all. ,2,00:14:28,,
182633,106,SAM,"Well, you sent the kitty, didn't you? ",2,00:14:33,,
182634,107,LIAM,"Yes, and we're not going to leave without him. Why don't we just--? ",2,00:14:35,,
182635,108,SAM,Follow behind a bit? ,2,00:14:40,,
182636,109,LIAM,That's right. ,2,00:14:42,,
182637,110,SAM,Okay. Sounds good. ,2,00:14:44,,
182638,111,MATT,"All right, so as you guys exit, keeping a pace behind, watching the crownsguard guiding the current prisoners towards the actual city, Frumpkin keeping a zig-zagging distance behind and following. ",2,00:14:47,,
182639,112,LIAM,DM? ,2,00:15:06,,
182640,113,MATT,Yes? ,2,00:15:07,,
182641,114,LIAM,"Is it possible for me, if Nott is holding my hand and leading me, to go full third eye and walk blind and deaf here looking through Frumpkin's senses? ",2,00:15:08,,
182642,115,MATT,"I would say yes, but you are purely like-- because all you're doing is walking forward and you need someone to guide you. ",2,00:15:20,,
182643,116,LIAM,Right. ,2,00:15:26,,
182644,117,SAM,And he can't communicate to me either so-- ,2,00:15:27,,
182645,118,LIAM,"I can talk, but I can't hear you. I can talk and hold her hand so she can stop me from prat-falling all over myself. ",2,00:15:29,,
182646,119,SAM,Yes. But you can talk? ,2,00:15:37,,
182647,120,MATT,He can talk but he can't hear you. ,2,00:15:39,,
182648,121,SAM,Got it. Okay. Great. ,2,00:15:41,,
182649,122,LIAM,But we've done this before so you know to squeeze my hand really hard if I should pipe down. ,2,00:15:43,,
182650,123,SAM,Sure. ,2,00:15:48,,
182651,124,MATT,"All right. So, first off, Beauregard. ",2,00:15:50,,
182652,125,MARISHA,Yeah. ,2,00:15:53,,
182653,126,MATT,"As you back out of the performer's exit of the tent into the center of their encampment, the immediate exit, there are already four crownsguard currently searching around and setting up a watch perimeter around the different tents. They're gathering and making sure none of the other performers have fled and a lot of them are being brought out into an area where there's a number of tents all facing towards a large campfire in the center. There's a couple of chairs set up there, it's kind of the common area for the performers of the carnival and it looks like they're all being put out there so they can get a bead on it and make sure they know where everyone else is. ",2,00:15:54,,
182654,127,MARISHA,"I'm going to try to be aloof, stealth a little bit. I don't want to make myself completely known. ",2,00:16:27,,
182655,128,MATT,Are you trying to stealth out of sight or just trying to not draw attention? ,2,00:16:34,,
182656,129,MARISHA,"No, just trying not to draw attention. ",2,00:16:38,,
182657,130,MATT,"Okay, all right. Go and make a stealth check just to see if-- ",2,00:16:40,,
182658,131,SAM,"Wait, did we just all ditch Marisha? ",2,00:16:45,,
182659,132,LAURA,She just walked out. ,2,00:16:48,,
182660,133,MARISHA,I ditched you. That's cocked. That's better. 17. ,2,00:16:49,,
182661,134,MATT,"17. Okay. As you kind of dart through the flap of the tent and move behind one of the large carts that currently is still affixed to a horse that is currently just chewing on an apple, and you hear the crunch in its teeth, you glance over past the edge of the immediate near tent and you can see this group gathering there and it appears that no one's immediately aware of your presence. ",2,00:16:59,,
182662,135,MARISHA,Do I see the little girl whose name was-- what was her name? ,2,00:17:20,,
182663,136,MATT,"Toya. You do not see her yet. The guard just got out there and they're just beginning to pull people out. You do see the fire dancer brought out there. You then see the two-- Yeah, Ornna. The Knot sisters are brought out and pushed out there and they're all looking very frustrated. ",2,00:17:24,,
182664,137,MARISHA,Are people being amicable? ,2,00:17:45,,
182665,138,MATT,"Yeah, they're not shoving them around, they're just calling them out to the front so they know where they are. ",2,00:17:46,,
182666,139,MARISHA,"Okay. I want to look around. Do I see any type of movement in the shadows, anyone looking suspicious? ",2,00:17:52,,
182667,140,MATT,Make a perception check. ,2,00:17:58,,
182668,141,MARISHA,Ooh yeah! Natural 18. 21. ,2,00:18:00,,
182669,142,MATT,"21. Okay, as you glance about, you don't see anything lurking in the shadows. What you do notice, though, is one of them bring Toya out of one of the-- the tent that's on the southern side and as he brings her out, there's a heavy thud sound, and you see coming out from behind the tent the large form of-- you heard the name Kylre once, but the ''devil toad."" The obese lizard man who's stomping up behind. ",2,00:18:06,,
182670,143,LAURA,Is he a dude or is he a creature? ,2,00:18:39,,
182671,144,MATT,"It looks like a lizard man, so scaled, humanoid, but extremely thick, bulbous belly, large, almost frog-like legs-- ",2,00:18:41,,
182672,145,TRAVIS,Bipedal or on all fours? ,2,00:18:52,,
182673,146,MATT,"Due to the size of his form, mostly all fours and lumbering forward on all of them but sits back on a bipedal situation. ",2,00:18:57,,
182674,147,MARISHA,So they're bringing the both of them out? ,2,00:19:06,,
182675,148,MATT,"The toad is hiding behind the tent and as soon as Toya comes out, comes up to the guard and puffs up its chest. The guard spins around and goes for the blade and pulls it out just carefully. ",2,00:19:08,,
182676,149,MARISHA,Am I still next to that horse? ,2,00:19:21,,
182677,150,MATT,"The horse is currently still up on the cart, but is about 30 feet from you. ",2,00:19:23,,
182678,151,SAM,Beast Shape! ,2,00:19:35,,(laughter) 
182679,152,MARISHA,I'm going to take my staff and give a really nice whack to the horse to get it to run. ,2,00:19:40,,
182680,153,MATT,You know what? Let's go ahead and make an animal handling check on that. ,2,00:19:48,,
182681,154,SAM,We never get to make those! ,2,00:19:51,,
182682,155,LIAM,First of the show! ,2,00:19:53,,
182683,156,MARISHA,"Oh my god, I'm so nervous right now. ",2,00:19:55,,
182684,157,TRAVIS,"You're good, you're good, you're good. ",2,00:20:01,,
182685,158,MARISHA,That's not great. 11? ,2,00:20:02,,
182686,159,MATT,"11 will do. It wasn't a hard DC, but it was more knowing where to hit it to where it would cause it to bolt versus just get angry. ",2,00:20:05,,
182687,160,MARISHA,"Get pissed, sure, kick me. ",2,00:20:12,,
182688,161,MATT,"So going for-- not to actually hurt the creature but just enough to spook it, you hit it in the right place towards the back of its hindquarters to cause it to suddenly rear up     and go into a sprint. The cart begins to bounce and smash onto the ground. You can see the wheels clattering into the rocks and the stone between the bits of-- ",2,00:20:14,,(neighs) (cart clattering noise)
182689,162,MARISHA,I'm going to bolt in the opposite direction and try and loop around to the south side of the tent. ,2,00:20:33,,
182690,163,MATT,"Make another stealth check, please. ",2,00:20:38,,
182691,164,MARISHA,"Big dice, big dice. Okay, 19! ",2,00:20:39,,
182692,165,MATT,"""Check!"" Points to them and then bolts off to go after the horse. The other three stay, watching over the group. ",2,00:20:45,,
182693,166,MARISHA,"Okay, can I loop around, kind of come up behind them? ",2,00:21:17,,
182694,167,MATT,"I mean, they're scattered a bit but there's-- ",2,00:21:19,,
182695,168,MARISHA,The devil toad and Toya. ,2,00:21:21,,
182696,169,MATT,Oh yeah. Make another stealth check. You're running through open areas each time you're doing this. ,2,00:21:23,,
182697,170,MARISHA,Yep.  Did you see that?! It leaned to a four. Ten. ,2,00:21:27,,(yells)
182698,171,TRAVIS,That is a bastard die right there. ,2,00:21:37,,
182699,172,MARISHA,That sucked. ,2,00:21:39,,
182700,173,TRAVIS,That's a tease. ,2,00:21:40,,
182701,174,MARISHA,"Laura, put him in the dice jail. ",2,00:21:41,,
182702,175,LAURA,"I don't have my dice jail out yet. It's okay, he'll chill there. ",2,00:21:43,,
182703,176,MATT,"As you come up around the back of the devil toad, the guard that runs past doesn't immediately notice you because he's focused on where this cart is running off and you can see another guard that was far away from this encampment that's circling back with him. The two of them are now bolting in the direction as the cart begins to slow. It's not just going forward forever but it spooked him and it's starting to slow down. They're just going to inspect it. However, as you slink up behind, the devil toad's head curls back towards you and you hear this deep, guttural . ",2,00:21:47,,(growls)
182704,177,MARISHA,"""Okay. It's okay. Toya?"" And I look at Toya. ""Hey, come on, let's get out of here, let's go."" ",2,00:22:16,,
182705,178,MATT,"At which point a voice says, ""Excuse me?!"" And you can see the three guards are there staring at you. ",2,00:22:24,,
182706,179,MARISHA,Fuck. You didn't say there were fucking guards. ,2,00:22:32,,
182707,180,MATT,I did say there were three guards. The three guards watching them. ,2,00:22:35,,
182708,181,MARISHA,I thought you said they left. ,2,00:22:39,,
182709,182,MATT,One of them left. ,2,00:22:41,,
182710,183,MARISHA,One of them left. So wait. Oh shit. ,2,00:22:43,,
182711,184,MATT,"It's a bad stealth check, I'm sorry. But there's now three crownsguard right there and they're like, ""Can I help you?"" ",2,00:22:45,,
182712,185,TRAVIS,Time to go to jail. ,2,00:22:52,,
182713,186,LAURA,"Oh, this is so exciting. ",2,00:22:53,,
182714,187,SAM,Kill them all. ,2,00:22:56,,
182715,188,MARISHA,Ey! I was actually just looking for the loo? ,2,00:22:58,,
182716,189,MATT,"The guard that's closest to you glances to the other guys and goes, ""She was with the group, right?"" They recognize you, and they look at each other. ""You're going to the stockade, my dear."" ",2,00:23:05,,
182717,190,MARISHA,No! ,2,00:23:20,,
182718,191,MATT,The three guards slowly approach and they begin to take out chains and manacle you up. ,2,00:23:23,,
182719,192,SAM,"In an effort not to go to jail, you went ",2,00:23:28,,
182720,193,MARISHA,I'm trying to get the girl. I was trying to free the damn girl. ,2,00:23:33,,
182721,194,MATT,I know. ,2,00:23:37,,
182722,195,TALIESIN,You'll be fine. ,2,00:23:39,,
182723,196,MATT,So you're shackled and begin to be dragged toward the stockade. ,2,00:23:42,,
182724,197,MARISHA,"It's just the two guards, right? ",2,00:23:47,,
182725,198,MATT,"It's the two guards now. As you're being brought back, you can see more guards are coming from the city to the carnival. They're keeping it under surveillance. ",2,00:23:51,,
182726,199,MARISHA,So are they taking me away? ,2,00:23:59,,
182727,200,MATT,"They're taking you to the city, yeah. ",2,00:24:00,,
182728,201,MARISHA,What are they doing with Toya? Anything? Are they leaving them behind? ,2,00:24:02,,
182729,202,MATT,"They're leaving them behind currently with the guards that are there. They're not arresting anybody from the carnival, but they're not letting them leave. But they're keeping them there. ",2,00:24:04,,
182730,203,MARISHA,Okay. I'm going to do a quick-- ,2,00:24:13,,
182731,204,SAM,Kill them all. ,2,00:24:21,,
182732,205,MARISHA,I'm in shackles? ,2,00:24:23,,
182733,206,MATT,You are. ,2,00:24:24,,
182734,207,MARISHA,"Okay. I'm going to do some monk shit here. I'm going to elbow one of the guards. Right in the ribs. And take the other one and bash the other one in the face and then I'm going to turn to Toya and I'm going to say, ""Run! Run! Go! Run!"" ",2,00:24:26,,
182735,208,MATT,Okay. Go ahead and-- ,2,00:24:41,,
182736,209,SAM,Make all kinds of rolls. ,2,00:24:45,,
182737,210,MATT,"First, go ahead and make an athletics check. ",2,00:24:47,,
182738,211,"MARISHA, SAM",This is a terrible idea. ,2,00:24:49,,
182739,212,LAURA,"To not drag any attention towards her, you are completely shoving her into the limelight. ",2,00:24:54,,
182740,213,MARISHA,Trying to distract these fucking assholes. That is a six. Ten. ,2,00:25:01,,
182741,214,MATT,You imagine in your head; you go over it two or three times. As you go through the first step--  doesn't go anywhere. ,2,00:25:08,,(grunt)
182742,215,TRAVIS,Tried to do the Sherlock Holmes. ,2,00:25:30,,
182743,216,MARISHA,"Do I at least get the ""Run!"" out to Toya? ",2,00:25:31,,
182744,217,MATT,No. I'm sorry. ,2,00:25:37,,
182745,218,MARISHA,Is she just standing there? Waiting for a guard? ,2,00:25:40,,
182746,219,TRAVIS,,2,00:25:44,,(laughter) 
182747,220,MARISHA,What is she doing? Is she running? ,2,00:25:49,,
182748,221,MATT,"No. Honestly, the devil toad and her seem pretty close. He is grabbing her in a protective manner. ",2,00:25:55,,
182749,222,MARISHA,"No, they can both run. Run for your life! Fine, whatever. She wants to get arrested at this point. ",2,00:26:01,,
182750,223,MATT,Two bad rolls in a row. I know. Level two. ,2,00:26:10,,
182751,224,MARISHA,I go join my friends. ,2,00:26:15,,
182752,225,MATT,"You will shortly. Ahead of her, along the way, Gustav is just quiet. Bo the Breaker, Bosun, as you know him by his full name, is grumbling under his breath and is trying to out-loud piece together thoughts on what may have what transpired, saying things like, ""I don't know, you think it's done on the inside? Or is this somebody trying to sabotage it?"" ",2,00:26:18,,
182753,226,TALIESIN,I think maybe it has nothing to do with us. I think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire. ,2,00:26:48,,
182754,227,MATT,It is quite possible. ,2,00:26:52,,
182755,228,TALIESIN,"Sorry, sir. Trying to keep my mouth shut. ",2,00:26:53,,
182756,229,MATT,"""All right, bring them forward."" They go ahead and pull the chains up. The watchmaster bows his head and then leaves the room. She steps forward and goes, ""I am Norda. It is my job to keep this city safe and keep shite like what happened tonight from happening. I approved your second time on the outskirts of our town and you have killed two of my people. What have you to say about yourselves?"" ",2,00:26:57,,
182757,230,TALIESIN,"Exactly how did we kill them, exactly? ",2,00:29:42,,
182758,231,MATT,"She glances over at you. Glances over at Gustav, ""I have been told by my guard that you gave performance, and as part of this performance you released two beasts into the midst of the population."" ",2,00:29:45,,
182759,232,LAURA,Technically. ,2,00:30:03,,
182760,233,TALIESIN,"Thank you. Yes, you see-- ",2,00:30:09,,
182761,234,MATT,"Gustav interrupts you and says, ""I'm so sorry, my liege. Please, I take full responsibility for what happened this evening on myself. These people around me had nothing to do with this. They are not part of the carnival, they were just merely helping. It is my carnival, and whatever judgement there lies, I take upon myself and my head."" At which point Bo the half-orc steps forward, against his chains and goes, ""Gustav, what are you doing?"" He's like, ""Shut. Up. Please, whatever judgement there is, put it upon me,"" and he bows his head low. ""Is that the case? Is he the only one?"" She takes a good, hard look at you and Bo the Breaker. ",2,00:30:14,,
182762,235,TALIESIN,"Oh, are you waiting for me to speak? Yes, he's the only one. ",2,00:31:04,,
182763,236,MATT,Make a persuasion check. ,2,00:31:08,,
182764,237,TALIESIN,"Natural 20. About fucking time, you little shit! ",2,00:31:12,,
182765,238,MATT,"We'll be talking to you very soon."" At which point, the crownsguard drag the chains back and Gustav gives you a quick look under his eye and goes-- as they're pulled out of the room, out of sight. She glances to you, ""Well, you're out of chains! That's great. Doesn't mean you're absolved of the investigation. So, where are you staying? You and your compatriots?"" ",2,00:31:19,,
182766,239,LAURA,"Well, technically we just all met, technically. ",2,00:31:59,,
182767,240,MATT,"""Well, technically, as far as I'm concerned, you're all together as part of this investigation."" ",2,00:32:03,,
182768,241,LAURA,We're a group you guys! ,2,00:32:09,,(laughter) 
182769,242,MATT,"""So we're going to have our investigators come to wherever you're staying, which--,"" and she looks down at some papers here, ""-- looks to be the Nestled Nook?"" ",2,00:32:16,,
182770,243,TRAVIS,That's correct. ,2,00:32:27,,
182771,244,MATT,"""All right. Don't leave the city. We'll be in touch."" ",2,00:32:29,,
182772,245,LAURA,"Great, I really like it here so that's good that we get to stay so long. ",2,00:32:34,,
182773,246,MATT,"""Do you have something to say?"" ",2,00:32:41,,
182774,247,TALIESIN,No. Just shocked to see someone die in front of me not more than-- ,2,00:32:44,,
182775,248,TRAVIS,"I can assure you, we're here to cause no trouble. We will be as compliant as we possibly can be. ",2,00:32:51,,
182776,249,MATT,"""Good. Dismissed!"" She claps the edge of the table. The remaining crownsguard, who's left there to keep watch, escorts you out off the stockade, escorts you onto the street. ",2,00:32:58,,
182777,250,LAURA,Her accent is really strong! It's hard to not match her accent! ,2,00:33:13,,(laughter) 
182778,251,TALIESIN,It's the one accent that I really have trouble with. ,2,00:33:21,,
182779,252,TRAVIS,Would you call it infectious? ,2,00:33:23,,
182780,253,TALIESIN,Bastard. ,2,00:33:25,,
182781,254,MATT,Sorry. ,2,00:33:27,,
182782,255,TALIESIN,The one that we know is a problem. ,2,00:33:28,,
182783,256,LIAM,"I'm going to call my cat back to me and I drop the telepathy and I just start tugging you back to the Nestled Nook. Come on, we have to talk about this. We have to decide what we're going to do. ",2,00:33:31,,
182784,257,SAM,Right away. ,2,00:33:44,,
182785,258,TRAVIS,Excuse me-- ,2,00:33:45,,
182786,259,LAURA,They're not with us. ,2,00:33:46,,
182787,260,TRAVIS,"Oh, I thought you were right behind us. ",2,00:33:47,,
182788,261,LIAM,"My cat was in there, but not I. ",2,00:33:49,,
182789,262,MATT,"Yeah, but you'd have to stay within 100 feet to maintain that. ",2,00:33:50,,
182790,263,LIAM,"Well, we would've walked up to the building, the cat would've scurried around, if possible. So I'd like to think that I heard all that, which is why just I said all the things I did. ",2,00:33:53,,
182791,264,MATT,"Yeah, you can do that. So, you guys are jettisoned into the street. It's now probably just past midnight. ",2,00:34:01,,
182792,265,TRAVIS,"Mollymauk, I don't mean to pry into your business, but has this ever happened to you before? ",2,00:34:16,,
182793,266,TALIESIN,"This has never-- anything like this has ever happened before. And thank you. For the record, I don't owe any of you anything-- ",2,00:34:21,,
182794,267,TRAVIS,"Oh, I don't know about that. ",2,00:34:29,,
182795,268,TALIESIN,"--I swear, but thank you, and I'm ready to help with this. ",2,00:34:31,,
182796,269,LAURA,Do you think it was the little girl? ,2,00:34:36,,
182797,270,TALIESIN,It's just a show! ,2,00:34:38,,
182798,271,TRAVIS,"Right, the large toad that was with the girl, what's the story there? ",2,00:34:44,,
182799,272,TALIESIN,"It's nothing special, it's just a guy making a buck, all right? He's fine! ",2,00:34:51,,
182800,273,MATT,You hear the footfalls of guards approach and the rattle of chains as you see Beauregard-- ,2,00:34:58,,
182801,274,TALIESIN,"By the way, where's the obnoxious one? The really loud-- ",2,00:35:04,,
182802,275,MATT,And she's just being led towards the stockade. ,2,00:35:17,,
182803,276,MARISHA,Help. ,2,00:35:20,,
182804,277,LAURA,What happened? ,2,00:35:21,,
182805,278,MARISHA,"Help. I'm with you, I'm with you. Help help. ",2,00:35:26,,
182806,279,LAURA,"Oh, I thought you didn't like jails. ",2,00:35:28,,
182807,280,MARISHA,Help. ,2,00:35:30,,(clears throat)
182808,281,TALIESIN,Is this part of the show by the way? I was just curious. ,2,00:35:34,,
182809,282,TRAVIS,"Unfortunately, no. ",2,00:35:37,,
182810,283,MATT,Which is the last thing you see as she is yanked into the stockade and out of sight. ,2,00:35:40,,
182811,284,TALIESIN,I'm going to be very helpful and not go in there with the two of you while you try and get her out. ,2,00:35:44,,
182812,285,LAURA,So should we go in and try to get her out? ,2,00:35:48,,
182813,286,TRAVIS,"Well, yeah! ",2,00:35:50,,
182814,287,LAURA,Okay. ,2,00:35:51,,
182815,288,TALIESIN,I'll stand guard. ,2,00:35:53,,
182816,289,LAURA,We'll follow her in. ,2,00:35:54,,
182817,290,TRAVIS,Don't. Leave. ,2,00:35:56,,
182818,291,TALIESIN,I have nowhere to go. ,2,00:35:57,,
182819,292,MATT,"You walk in behind her. You watch her being pulled to the stairs. She's bypassing the office of the Lawmaster right now and is being brought to incarceration before being questioned. They bring her to the stairs and a torch-lit, subterranean basement area. As you begin to approach and follow behind, you can see one of the guards who is currently on watch. He sees you guys just exit and then walk back in, following another prisoner. And stands up and goes, ""I'm sorry, where are you going?"" ",2,00:35:59,,
182820,293,TRAVIS,Bad luck. ,2,00:36:27,,
182821,294,LAURA,She was also helping to save a lot of people. Big misunderstanding. ,2,00:36:38,,
182822,295,MATT,"""Well, see her into her cell and please exit the vicinity."" ",2,00:36:44,,
182823,296,TRAVIS,Fair enough. ,2,00:36:48,,
182824,297,MATT,"""Appreciate that."" He follows behind you guys. They're on high alert and they're a bit scattered. You get the sense right now that they have a lot of their initial stock of guards off-site right now. So they're doing the best they can to hold on to what they currently have in the stockade. ",2,00:36:50,,
182825,298,TRAVIS,"To the side I say to Jester, I say: This does not really fall in with keeping a low profile. We talked about this. ",2,00:37:07,,
182826,299,LAURA,I know isn't it so weird? ,2,00:37:13,,
182827,300,TRAVIS,"Yeah, it is. ",2,00:37:17,,
182828,301,MATT,"And there is probably a total of ten cells to each side. As you walk through, you can see in the off shadows in the corners a few huddled bodies hunched or asleep. Keeping to the shadows and out of the light. The smell of mildewed wet compost and piss hits your nose like a wall. ",2,00:37:21,,
182829,302,LAURA,,2,00:38:15,,(laughter) 
182830,303,MATT,"You get about five cells in where you can see the guard that was previously in there just finish off closing the cell that contains both Gustav and Bo the Breaker. They move to the cell just beyond that, open that cell, and then go ahead and put Beauregard into that one. ",2,00:38:22,,
182831,304,TRAVIS,Are they not going to take her to see the Lawmaker? ,2,00:38:41,,
182832,305,LAURA,"I know, why doesn't she get to talk to the Lawmaster? ",2,00:38:43,,
182833,306,MATT,"As he closes and locks it, ""Because she decided not to come helpfully."" ",2,00:38:46,,
182834,307,LAURA,What do you mean? ,2,00:38:53,,
182835,308,MARISHA,"It was an injury from, like, a childhood thing. ",2,00:38:55,,
182836,309,LAURA,"Oh no, are you guys making fun of her because of her spasm? ",2,00:39:07,,
182837,310,MARISHA,Yeah that's actually--  it was very sensitive for me. I had a really tough childhood. I was just trying to find a bathroom. ,2,00:39:12,,(fake crying)
182838,311,MATT,"The three guards walk away, not caring. Who were there previously and-- ",2,00:39:21,,
182839,312,SAM,Spasm shaming. ,2,00:39:26,,
182840,313,MATT,"At this point, a man who is on the far end of the hall walks up. And you can see him, he's a man with a heavy, bushy beard that obscures a lot of a dark leather mantle, over a general cloth tunic. He has burly arms, heavy torso, super scrawny legs, a widow's peak, and he looks to be the jailer. He walks up and puts his hand on the bars and goes, ""Oh well, if you want to be patient, I'm sure the Lawmaster will be here sometime in the morning and you can discuss whatever this business is. But if you want to say goodbye, now's the time."" ",2,00:39:28,,
182841,314,TRAVIS,"Actually, we were just upstairs and it would really help us if we could, perhaps, expedite the process. Perhaps there's an arrangement we could come to if she could see the Lawmaster now. ",2,00:40:05,,
182842,315,MARISHA,"Yeah, I'm looking injured, man. I show him my eight hit points of damage. ",2,00:40:16,,
182843,316,TALIESIN,How many kittens is that again? ,2,00:40:27,,
182844,317,MATT,"That's sixteen kittens. Kittens have half of a hit point, I don't think kittens have more than that. ",2,00:40:30,,
182845,318,LIAM,That's eight Frumpkins. ,2,00:40:34,,
182846,319,TRAVIS,An audience is all we're asking for. No favors. ,2,00:40:36,,
182847,320,MARISHA,"Yeah, this is just a wrong time, wrong place thing. ",2,00:40:39,,

182853,326,LAURA,"She's a very calm person. I've never seen her angry, ever. ",2,00:40:57,,
182854,327,MATT,"He gives a whistle. Another crownsguard comes up and approaches him and he goes, ""I'm sorry. Could you go and fetch the Lawmaster? They are requesting an audience. If she gets angry, just add it to this one's sentence."" The guard exits and a brief time by, you can hear the slight muddled cursing of a dwarven female descending the stairs. You can see she has an overcoat on, was halfway out of the stockades finishing up her evening in her office. ",2,00:41:01,,
182855,328,TRAVIS,"Beau, remember your little sister. ",2,00:41:30,,
182856,329,SAM,"Oh, what? Little sister? What? ",2,00:41:33,,
182857,330,LIAM,We're not there. ,2,00:41:35,,
182858,331,MATT,"So, as the Lawmaster approaches, now pulling the coat over herself, she goes, ""Okay, so you've returned, apparently, needing to poke into what business now before I go off and get some food?"" ",2,00:41:39,,
182859,332,TRAVIS,"I do hate to trouble you again, twice in the same evening. It's incredibly inconvenient. ",2,00:41:52,,
182860,333,MATT,"""I hate being troubled twice in the same evening."" ",2,00:41:56,,
182861,334,TRAVIS,"If we may, this sweet girl here was also part of our party and she is quite the protective one. I'm afraid that she was also providing aid to our fellows in that tent. I'm afraid her younger sister was attacked in a similar way. I feel it's only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to protect this young dwarven girl that performed in the circus. She means no harm. ",2,00:41:58,,
182862,335,LAURA,It was an adopted sister. ,2,00:42:24,,
182863,336,MARISHA,I practically raised her. It's a sensitive subject. ,2,00:42:28,,
182864,337,MATT,Okay. I would like a deception check. ,2,00:42:32,,
182865,338,TRAVIS,"Oh, yeah baby. 24. Natural 18. ",2,00:42:38,,
182866,339,MATT,Modified by their answers. ,2,00:42:45,,
182867,340,LAURA,I was helping! ,2,00:42:51,,
182868,341,TRAVIS,I'm new at this stat! Don't fuck it up! ,2,00:42:53,,
182869,342,MATT,"She gives a narrow look through her eyes, looks to one of the other guards that you can see standing in the back, a familiar one to you, Beau, and goes, ""Is this true?"" He goes, ""It appeared to us that she was attempting to escape upon us trying to bring calm to a very tense situation, but I'll leave it in your realm, Lawmaster."" She looks back. ""So your sister, apparently, is part of this scenario as well?"" ",2,00:42:58,,
182870,343,MARISHA,Adopted sister. ,2,00:43:32,,
182871,344,MATT,"""Okay. Well, your sister's under investigation."" ",2,00:43:37,,
182872,345,MARISHA,Sure. ,2,00:43:40,,
182873,346,LAURA,She's staying at the same place that we are. ,2,00:43:44,,
182874,347,TRAVIS,The Nestled Nook Inn is where we are. ,2,00:43:47,,
182875,348,MARISHA,"And I'm more than willing to be compliant with the investigation. In fact, you can see the injury the beast left on my ribs, so if you want to test it for any type of specimen samples, feel free. It's very painful, but I'm willing to do it for the cause. ",2,00:43:51,,
182876,349,LAURA,Do you need me to heal that? MARISHA : No! For the cause! Do it for the cause! ,2,00:44:09,,(through gritted teeth)
182877,350,MATT,"At which she looks to you now and goes, ""Are you saying you might have been infected by this beast?"" ",2,00:44:14,,
182878,351,MARISHA,"No. It's a separate issue. There was two things going on. There was, like, the big angry toad beast and he got a swipe at me. And then there were people who were getting attacked. ",2,00:44:21,,
182879,352,MATT,"""Theeds!"" And she looks over to the jailer, who goes, ""Aye?"" And she goes, ""Could you have a look at this wound for me real fast? I want to make sure this isn't something that's going to spread."" ",2,00:44:35,,
182880,353,MARISHA,Yeah! Yeah. Uh-huh. ,2,00:44:42,,
182881,354,TRAVIS,A great idea indeed. And thankfully there was no flesh-to-flesh contact. ,2,00:44:44,,
182882,355,MARISHA,Nope. ,2,00:44:46,,
182883,356,LAURA,,2,00:44:48,,(laughter) 
182884,357,MATT,"The jailer, Theeds, takes a quick look at the wound and he goes, ""No, it appears to mainly be just bludgeoning. I mean, we'll keep a close eye on her."" You can see now the Lawmaster is rubbing her eyes in frustration and goes, ""I just want to sleep."" ",2,00:45:02,,
182885,358,TRAVIS,Indeed. It would give us no greater pleasure than to get out of your hair. ,2,00:45:23,,
182886,359,MATT,"""Fine. We'll have guards posted at the outside of the inn. You're not to leave until this investigation is complete. It may take days. Until we find out who's responsible for these deaths and bring them to justice, you are not to leave the tavern."" ",2,00:45:28,,
182887,360,TRAVIS,Understood. ,2,00:45:50,,
182888,361,LAURA,"Like, at all during the day, even? Just a question. If we wanted to shop or something. Not okay? ",2,00:45:51,,
182889,362,MATT,"""Not until this is done."" ",2,00:45:59,,
182890,363,LAURA,Cool. ,2,00:46:00,,
182891,364,MATT,"""Because otherwise, you're welcome to stay here, instead."" ",2,00:46:01,,
182892,365,LAURA,"It is really beautiful here, but I think I'd rather stay at the inn? ",2,00:46:05,,
182893,366,TRAVIS,"Indeed we would. This is most gracious of you, Lawmaster Norda. ",2,00:46:10,,
182894,367,MATT,"They escort you guys to the actual inn itself, to the bottom floor of the Nestled Nook Inn, watch you enter, and then post up right outside the main entrance to the tavern. ",2,00:46:15,,
182895,368,LAURA,You should have spasmed a couple times on the way here. ,2,00:46:56,,
182896,369,MARISHA,"Aw, shit. ",2,00:46:59,,
182897,370,LAURA,Yeah. Opportunity missed. ,2,00:47:00,,
182898,371,MARISHA,My little sister? What the what? ,2,00:47:02,,
182899,372,LAURA,She's a dwarf! She's human! ,2,00:47:05,,
182900,373,TRAVIS,"What? No, I was trying to say she had a little sister that had a similar incident and that made you try to protect Toya. I was trying to throw you a bone. ",2,00:47:07,,
182901,374,LAURA,Oh. You didn't make that clear at all. ,2,00:47:16,,
182902,375,MATT,"Are you guys up in your room, or are you in the tavern? ",2,00:47:19,,
182903,376,LIAM,Yeah. We're having a talk. ,2,00:47:21,,
182904,377,TRAVIS,We're under watch. ,2,00:47:22,,
182905,378,MARISHA,I was just trying to go with what you said. ,2,00:47:24,,
182906,379,TRAVIS,Yeah. You did all right. ,2,00:47:26,,
182907,380,MARISHA,"All right. I mean, it kind of worked. But you're not entirely wrong! I was trying to go get the stupid little girl, who seemed to be stupid. ",2,00:47:28,,
182908,381,TRAVIS,Did you see anything? ,2,00:47:38,,
182909,382,MARISHA,"I tried to save her. I was like, get the hint, what's going on? ",2,00:47:39,,
182910,383,LAURA,Why would you save her? She turned those people into zombies. ,2,00:47:43,,
182911,384,MARISHA,,2,00:47:46,,(stammers) 
182912,385,TRAVIS,We don't know that. ,2,00:47:47,,
182913,386,LAURA,"I mean, she could have. ",2,00:47:49,,
182914,387,TALIESIN,She didn't. ,2,00:47:50,,
182915,388,LAURA,"Oh, hi! You're here. ",2,00:47:51,,
182916,389,MARISHA,"Yeah, if anything, we should be looking at this guy. Why are we putting our neck out for you? ",2,00:47:54,,
182917,390,TALIESIN,"You're putting your neck out for Toya for some strange reason and I don't know why, she's perfectly capable of handling herself. ",2,00:48:02,,
182918,391,TRAVIS,Have you been to this town before? ,2,00:48:08,,
182919,392,TALIESIN,Not that I can remember. They all look the same after a while. ,2,00:48:09,,
182920,393,MATT,"You've come through once, but that was a while back and you weren't really paying attention. ",2,00:48:14,,
182921,394,TALIESIN,"Busy, yeah. ",2,00:48:19,,
182922,395,TRAVIS,And you've never seen conditions like this affect any other carnival goer before? ,2,00:48:20,,
182923,396,TALIESIN,Nothing. Never. It's not us. ,2,00:48:23,,
182924,397,LAURA,"So great! We're stuck in a city that has zombie issues, that's all. ",2,00:48:32,,
182925,398,TRAVIS,Where are the other two? ,2,00:48:36,,
182926,399,TALIESIN,Which other two? ,2,00:48:38,,
182927,400,TRAVIS,The stinky one and the little one. ,2,00:48:40,,
182928,401,TALIESIN,"Oh, your friends! ",2,00:48:44,,
182929,402,TRAVIS,Yeah. Can we look around and see if we spot Caleb and-- ,2,00:48:46,,
182930,403,TALIESIN,You call them Stinky and the little one? All right. ,2,00:48:49,,
182931,404,MATT,They don't appear to be nearby. ,2,00:48:52,,
182932,405,TRAVIS,I wonder if they came back. ,2,00:48:57,,
182933,406,LAURA,I'll go up and ask the tavern keeper. ,2,00:48:58,,
182934,407,MATT,Okay. Yorda? ,2,00:49:01,,
182935,408,LAURA,"Yeah, Yorda. ",2,00:49:02,,
182936,409,MATT,"""Oh, hi! Everything all right? You had a few bruiser types leading you in here, some of the crownsguard, huh?"" ",2,00:49:03,,
182937,410,LAURA,"Oh my gosh, there was this big trouble at the carnival, did you go? ",2,00:49:10,,
182938,411,MATT,"""I heard about that. I didn't go in there, but people are coming in here saying--"" ",2,00:49:13,,
182939,412,LAURA,Somebody turned into a zombie and then-- ,2,00:49:15,,
182940,413,MATT,"""I heard that! That's incredible!"" ",2,00:49:16,,
182941,414,LAURA,"Yeah! And then we're all under investigation because we saved them! These guards are weird. Hey, did you see the wizard guy, the stinky guy and the little halfling? ",2,00:49:18,,
182942,415,MATT,"""Yeah, they came in not but a few minutes before you did. They went upstairs."" ",2,00:49:32,,
182943,416,LAURA,"Oh, great! They're here! ",2,00:49:35,,
182944,417,TRAVIS,They are? ,2,00:49:36,,
182945,418,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,00:49:37,,
182946,419,TRAVIS,Good. ,2,00:49:38,,
182947,420,MATT,"Meanwhile, the two of you are upstairs in your own chambers. ",2,00:49:40,,
182948,421,LIAM,"During all of that, I would have dragged you back here, brought you upstairs. And I whip off my ratty coat, throw it on the bed and sit down on the ground so that I'm eye level with you, Nott. ",2,00:49:44,,
182949,422,SAM,Hi. ,2,00:49:54,,
182950,423,LIAM,"Nott, you and I have to make some decisions right now, okay? ",2,00:49:55,,
182951,424,SAM,Now? ,2,00:50:00,,
182952,425,LIAM,Yes. ,2,00:50:01,,
182953,426,SAM,Why? ,2,00:50:02,,
182954,427,LIAM,"Well, I know why we said we were coming here. ",2,00:50:04,,
182955,428,SAM,"Get some booze, got some books, find a little taste of civilization, maybe some better food. ",2,00:50:08,,
182956,429,LIAM,"Yeah. I didn't say, I also had the idea-- you know, you and I meeting and teaming up has been a good thing. ",2,00:50:15,,
182957,430,SAM,"Oh, yes, very good. I know everyone else makes fun of your smell, but I don't smell nothing. ",2,00:50:28,,
182958,431,LIAM,"I've changed my mind entirely, and I think we should go, but we can't now because we are stuck here for the moment. ",2,00:50:36,,
182959,432,SAM,Under sort of holding arrest or something? We can't leave the city. ,2,00:51:15,,
182960,433,LIAM,No. ,2,00:51:18,,
182961,434,SAM,"But I was thinking about this. The people we met down there and spent the day with: they are lunatics, but they draw a lot of attention to themselves, leaving us free to sort of slink back into the shadows a little bit. It might be sort of the perfect camouflage. No one's going to be looking for a little goblin girl anymore, because they'll be looking at the crazy people, the tieflings running around smashing shit. ",2,00:51:20,,
182962,435,LIAM,"You know, I had not thought of it quite in that way and that is a good point, but I am not convinced. I'm not convinced. And perhaps we're better off-- maybe I was too ambitious. ",2,00:51:54,,
182963,436,SAM,"Well, let's give it a day and if things seem a little bit, you know, skinky-doodie tomorrow, we can fritter away in the middle of the day or something. ",2,00:52:09,,
182964,437,LIAM,"All right. Well, we'll wait and see. While we're here, one thing, okay? No Money Pot. No Rat Food. None of those plays. I have silver, we don't need it right now. ",2,00:52:26,,
182965,438,SAM,"But we need to replenish the healing potion you used. If we don't have that, then what happens the next you get in trouble? ",2,00:52:41,,
182966,439,LIAM,"We're with a couple of tieflings, a little person in a doll mask, and a dirty ginger. We've got people staring at us every second of the day. We need to dial it back a little bit. ",2,00:52:48,,
182967,440,SAM,"All right, but how on earth are we-- all right. We can cool it with the cons for a couple of days. But I can't promise that I won't get the itch again. ",2,00:53:06,,
182968,441,LIAM,"You just talk to me. You hold Frumpkin. Just keep your hands full with Frumpkin, okay? Hold my cat, okay? ",2,00:53:21,,
182969,442,SAM,All right. ,2,00:53:28,,
182970,443,LIAM,And then this is going to blow over because we didn't do anything! We did something good. ,2,00:53:30,,
182971,444,SAM,"No! I didn't do nothing, we just went to a show. ",2,00:53:34,,
182972,445,LIAM,That's right. ,2,00:53:36,,
182973,446,SAM,"It was a pretty good show. Up until, you know, the dead people part. ",2,00:53:37,,
182974,447,LIAM,"But it was a good show, wasn't it? ",2,00:53:42,,
182975,448,SAM,"Yeah! Well, we'll lay low. Should we pretend that we're still friends with these people? ",2,00:53:44,,
182976,449,LIAM,"I was going to suggest the same thing. In fact, I think we should go downstairs. They're going to be coming back. We don't want to cause a stir with them, either. We just want to leave if that's what we're going to do. ",2,00:53:51,,
182977,450,SAM,Don't worry! I'll turn on the charm. ,2,00:54:03,,
182978,451,TALIESIN,Thank God. ,2,00:54:08,,
182979,452,LIAM,Okay. Let's get a drink. ,2,00:54:09,,
182980,453,SAM,Thank gods. ,2,00:54:15,,
182981,454,LIAM,We head downstairs. ,2,00:54:18,,
182982,455,MATT,"You guys head down. You get to the bottom of the stairs just in time to see Jester, Beauregard, Molly, and Fjord looking across the tavern, making their way in your direction, and you guys notice them meeting you in the tavern room, as well. ",2,00:54:19,,
182983,456,SAM,"Oh, thank God you're here and safe! We missed you! Somehow we got separated! Friends. ",2,00:54:32,,
182984,457,LAURA,"That happens, yes. ",2,00:54:43,,
182985,458,MARISHA,Can I insight check him? ,2,00:54:44,,
182986,459,MATT,Sure. ,2,00:54:46,,
182987,460,"SAM, MATT",Her. ,2,00:54:47,,
182988,461,MARISHA,Her. Sam. Natural 20. ,2,00:54:50,,
182989,462,SAM,I'm lying! ,2,00:54:54,,(laughter) 
182990,463,MARISHA,You guys peaced out pretty quickly. ,2,00:55:11,,
182991,464,LIAM,"We did, I did not come to Trostenwald to go to jail. ",2,00:55:17,,
182992,465,TRAVIS,What did you come to Trostenwald for? ,2,00:55:22,,
182993,466,LIAM,We are tired. We've been traveling a long time. We've been saving. Wanted to take it easy for a few days. ,2,00:55:26,,
182994,467,TRAVIS,"Sure, I'm not trying to pry. I was just curious where you were going. ",2,00:55:36,,
182995,468,MARISHA,Just curious why you have a mask. ,2,00:55:41,,
182996,469,TALIESIN,"If I'm going to listening to somebody's life story I'm going to need a drink. You, gorgeous, what's your name? ",2,00:55:42,,
182997,470,MATT,"You look over and see a woman with darker hair, the general barmaid. ""Adelaine."" ",2,00:55:47,,
182998,471,TALIESIN,"Adelaine, I would like a round for all these terrible people and one for myself. What's the difference between these three beers? I've honestly got to admit, they all taste the same to me. ",2,00:55:55,,
182999,472,MATT,"""Go with the von Brandt."" ",2,00:56:06,,
183000,473,TALIESIN,Let's get a round of von Brandt for everybody. ,2,00:56:09,,
183001,474,TRAVIS,"Actually, if it's all the same I'm not really an ale fan. Do you have any fire whiskey? ",2,00:56:13,,
183002,475,MATT,"""We can get you some liquor, aye."" ",2,00:56:18,,
183003,476,LAURA,Can I have some milk? ,2,00:56:21,,
183004,477,SAM,"Two, please. ",2,00:56:22,,
183005,478,MATT,"""All right."" She walks away. ",2,00:56:24,,
183006,479,LAURA,You think she heard that I wanted milk? ,2,00:56:29,,
183007,480,TALIESIN,I don't know. I'm going to ask for one of each of these beers because I want to have a tasting competition. I'm not going to be drinking alone. ,2,00:56:32,,
183008,481,LIAM,I wander away from these two with their questions and I sit down with Molly. ,2,00:56:39,,
183009,482,LAURA,"Caleb, you want to see something cool? ",2,00:56:43,,
183010,483,LIAM,I would love to see something cool. ,2,00:56:45,,
183011,484,LAURA,I show Caleb where I etched the dick in the table a couple nights ago. ,2,00:56:47,,
183012,485,MARISHA,Yeah! Bringing it back. ,2,00:56:51,,
183013,486,LIAM,That's pretty good. ,2,00:56:55,,
183014,487,TALIESIN,How'd you etch a deck in the table? ,2,00:56:56,,
183015,488,LAURA,It's a dick. ,2,00:56:58,,
183016,489,TALIESIN,Oh. ,2,00:56:59,,
183017,490,LIAM,Have you always been an artist? ,2,00:57:01,,
183018,491,LAURA,"I have actually, I've been an artist since I was little. ",2,00:57:03,,
183019,492,TALIESIN,You think that's what they look like? ,2,00:57:06,,
183020,493,LAURA,I've seen a lot of dicks. That is what most of them look like. ,2,00:57:08,,
183021,494,TALIESIN,I'm already in my cups. ,2,00:57:13,,
183022,495,LAURA,What? ,2,00:57:16,,
183023,496,LIAM,So where do you two come from? ,2,00:57:20,,
183024,497,LAURA,Us two? ,2,00:57:23,,
183025,498,LIAM,"Yes, you two with the horns. ",2,00:57:25,,
183026,499,LAURA,"Well, I don't know where he comes from. You think we all come from the same place? That was really inconsiderate. ",2,00:57:27,,
183027,500,LIAM,"No, you are very different it's very clear. ",2,00:57:34,,
183028,501,LAURA,He's purple. ,2,00:57:36,,
183029,502,TALIESIN,She's blue. ,2,00:57:37,,
183030,503,LAURA,Which is pretty rare. ,2,00:57:39,,
183031,504,LIAM,He's every color. ,2,00:57:41,,
183032,505,TALIESIN,It's very true. ,2,00:57:43,,
183033,506,LAURA,I'm from Nicodranas. ,2,00:57:49,,
183034,507,LIAM,Remember when we started the first campaign and all those places came in a split second and all that history. I'm from Shrev`nam Chicago. Oh yes. ,2,00:57:55,,
183035,508,TALIESIN,I'm from the circus. ,2,00:58:15,,
183036,509,LIAM,So you're a traveler then? ,2,00:58:18,,
183037,510,TALIESIN,Oh yeah. Quite a while. ,2,00:58:20,,
183038,511,LIAM,Since childhood? ,2,00:58:23,,
183039,512,TALIESIN,Long as I can reasonably remember at the very least. It's been a while. It's nice. I like it. They're good people. Work hard. ,2,00:58:26,,
183040,513,LIAM,You have a lot of scars. ,2,00:58:37,,
183041,514,TALIESIN,"That's a very funny story, actually. ",2,00:58:40,,
183042,515,TRAVIS,I like funny stories. ,2,00:58:43,,
183043,516,TALIESIN,Me too. ,2,00:58:45,,
183044,517,TRAVIS,You did some crazy shit with that sword of yours. ,2,00:58:49,,
183045,518,TALIESIN,Thank you. These swords-- you buy a drink and we'll see. ,2,00:58:53,,
183046,519,TRAVIS,You polish off that one already? ,2,00:59:03,,
183047,520,LAURA,"Wow, that's a lot-- okay. ",2,00:59:10,,
183048,521,TRAVIS,Can we get another round? For the-- ,2,00:59:14,,
183049,522,TALIESIN,How much I owe you for the first round? ,2,00:59:17,,
183050,523,MATT,They are keeping a tally of the table. ,2,00:59:20,,
183051,524,LIAM,Frumpkin scrabbles up onto Nott's shoulder. ,2,00:59:22,,
183052,525,SAM,"Hi Frumpy, nice to see you again. ",2,00:59:26,,
183053,526,TALIESIN,Mother always told me to never give a story away for free. ,2,00:59:30,,
183054,527,TRAVIS,Wise words. ,2,00:59:34,,
183055,528,LAURA,My mother said don't give away other things for free. ,2,00:59:35,,
183056,529,TALIESIN,I already like your mother. ,2,00:59:38,,
183057,530,MARISHA,My mother always said nothing in life is free. ,2,00:59:40,,
183058,531,TALIESIN,I can tell. ,2,00:59:43,,
183059,532,MARISHA,None of this absolves the dodgy goblin who slinked past that first question. Where are you from? What are you traveling from? Why the mask? ,2,00:59:45,,
183060,533,TRAVIS,Only because we seem to find ourselves in quite the predicament. ,2,00:59:57,,
183061,534,SAM,"We're just a couple of friends, strolling around the countryside looking for adventure. ",2,01:00:01,,
183062,535,MARISHA,Sure you are. ,2,01:00:07,,
183063,536,LIAM,Do you see many goblins walking around cities here? ,2,01:00:10,,
183064,537,MARISHA,It has nothing to do with that. People who move from place to place frequently tend to have other stories as to why they're doing it. ,2,01:00:15,,
183065,538,LIAM,"Well, let me make it clear: goblins are not typically welcome in any cities, that is why the mask. ",2,01:00:23,,
183066,539,MARISHA,"Well, you're going back to the goblin thing. I'm more curious about the travel thing. ",2,01:00:29,,
183067,540,SAM,"We have a string of bad luck. We tend to get in trouble in places for various reasons. Some of which is my fault. Most of which is my fault. I have sticky fingers. I can't help myself sometimes. I'm fascinated by little bobbles and fancy pieces of jewelries and I love trinkets so much! I just have to take them, and have them with me, and put them in my pockets. It's gotten us in a few scrapes a couple times. Caleb, he is fantastic. Very patient with me, understands. But really it's my fault; it's not him. He's a smart man, a brilliant magician! Have you seen? Some of his tricks are phenomenal, really. ",2,01:00:36,,
183068,541,TRAVIS,"No, I'd love to. ",2,01:01:29,,
183069,542,SAM,,2,01:01:31,,(laughter) 
183070,543,TRAVIS,It's a moving story. ,2,01:01:42,,
183071,544,MARISHA,"I immediately check my pockets after that to see is Nott has lifted anything. Is everything still there, all my coin? ",2,01:01:44,,
183072,545,MATT,Make an investigation check. ,2,01:01:52,,
183073,546,TALIESIN,I'm going to join you on this one. ,2,01:01:54,,
183074,547,MARISHA,Not great. Not great at all. Six. ,2,01:01:57,,
183075,548,TALIESIN,16. ,2,01:02:02,,
183076,549,MATT,16? Everything seems to be in order for you. ,2,01:02:04,,
183077,550,MARISHA,Wait that was a 15! Right? That was the dice I rolled? 16. ,2,01:02:07,,
183078,551,MATT,Everything seems to be in order. ,2,01:02:12,,
183079,552,MARISHA,Okay. ,2,01:02:15,,
183080,553,SAM,"Anyway, that's the long and short of it. ",2,01:02:18,,
183081,554,LAURA,What do you do with the things once you steal them? ,2,01:02:22,,
183082,555,SAM,Well the nice ones I keep. I have a little-- ,2,01:02:25,,
183083,556,LAURA,Do you have a collection? ,2,01:02:28,,
183084,557,SAM,"We were in one of those prisons before-- Am I sharing too much? I'm sharing too much, aren't I? We were in a prison, they took all of our belongings. I lost all of my collections. I had a lovely rock collection. I had a rare coin collection. I had a stick collection. Yeah, it's all gone now. ",2,01:02:30,,
183085,558,LAURA,"What about shiny things, though? ",2,01:03:02,,
183086,559,SAM,I love them. I just don't have any right now. ,2,01:03:04,,
183087,560,LAURA,"Because I think if you have sticky fingers for sticks and rocks, I don't think that will get you in trouble. ",2,01:03:06,,
183088,561,SAM,I mean I call them sticks because I don't need them. But I suppose they really needed them. ,2,01:03:26,,
183089,562,LAURA,"Yeah, that makes sense. ",2,01:03:32,,
183090,563,TALIESIN,There's only one way to find out. ,2,01:03:34,,
183091,564,MARISHA,"Wait, I'm sorry. I think I need clarification. If sticks mean things like valuable canes, what do rocks mean to you? ",2,01:03:38,,
183092,565,SAM,They're really nice rocks. ,2,01:03:49,,
183093,566,LIAM,We don't have many of those at the moment. ,2,01:03:58,,
183094,567,TRAVIS,"Would it be fair to say that the more someone desires something, the more you're interest increases? ",2,01:04:01,,
183095,568,SAM,"Oh I don't care about the people who have them. I just like pretty things. Toys, anything really. ",2,01:04:08,,
183096,569,LAURA,I'll keep an eye out for things that you would like. ,2,01:04:22,,
183097,570,SAM,Okay! Can you help with that? ,2,01:04:25,,
183098,571,LAURA,I can if you want me to. Or I can point it out. ,2,01:04:27,,
183099,572,MARISHA,Is it the joy of taking the things or do you just like gifts? ,2,01:04:32,,
183100,573,SAM,"No, it's the collecting. ",2,01:04:37,,
183101,574,LIAM,It's like a nervous tick a little bit. ,2,01:04:39,,
183102,575,TRAVIS,Are you good at it? Do you get caught very often? ,2,01:04:45,,
183103,576,SAM,"Well, would you like a demonstration? ",2,01:04:49,,
183104,577,LAURA,Yes! ,2,01:04:52,,
183105,578,TRAVIS,"Now, Jester, if I may, we are already in a little bit of a pickle. ",2,01:04:54,,
183106,579,LAURA,Steal something from me! Do you want me to close my eyes? ,2,01:04:59,,
183107,580,SAM,Sure! That'll make it really easy. Are they closed? ,2,01:05:03,,
183108,581,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,01:05:12,,
183109,582,SAM,All right. Out of practice here. I'm going to do a shot. Crack my knuckles. ,2,01:05:16,,
183110,583,LAURA,"Just don't take the thing on my waist, because he'll be pissed. ",2,01:05:28,,
183111,584,SAM,He'll be pissed? What? ,2,01:05:32,,
183112,585,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,01:05:35,,
183113,586,SAM,He? ,2,01:05:36,,
183114,587,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,01:05:37,,
183115,588,SAM,What's on your waist? ,2,01:05:38,,
183116,589,TALIESIN,I'm looking at her waist. What's on her waist? ,2,01:05:40,,
183117,590,MATT,What's on your waist? ,2,01:05:41,,
183118,591,LAURA,My symbol to the Traveler. ,2,01:05:43,,
183119,592,SAM,"Oh. All right, I'll go to her left buttcheek pocket and fish around. ",2,01:05:45,,
183120,593,LAURA,I'm in a dress. I don't have a pocket on my buttcheek. But you can try. ,2,01:05:51,,
183121,594,SAM,What pockets do you have? ,2,01:05:58,,
183122,595,LAURA,"I would have pockets on the front of my dress, and maybe a little pouch on my hip. ",2,01:06:03,,
183123,596,SAM,I'll do the hip pocket. ,2,01:06:09,,
183124,597,MATT,"All right, make a sleight of hand check. ",2,01:06:11,,
183125,598,SAM,,2,01:06:14,,(laughter) 
183126,599,MATT,You close your eyes and feel a tug and a shake-- ,2,01:06:18,,
183127,600,SAM,Plus eight. ,2,01:06:21,,
183128,601,MATT,What's your passive perception? ,2,01:06:24,,
183129,602,TALIESIN,I'm going to guess ten. ,2,01:06:27,,
183130,603,LAURA,"No, it's 13. ",2,01:06:29,,
183131,604,MATT,"So, yeah, you totally feel-- ",2,01:06:30,,
183132,605,LAURA,You're doing great! ,2,01:06:32,,
183133,606,SAM,"This is not how it usually works! The person is not really expecting it. This is embarrassing, really. I have the one skill and I failed at it. ",2,01:06:37,,
183134,607,LAURA,"It's okay, you can keep practicing. ",2,01:06:51,,
183135,608,LIAM,"Here, you know the trick, right? ",2,01:06:54,,
183136,609,SAM,"Yes, I know the trick. Takes a little bit of time, doesn't it? ",2,01:07:10,,
183137,610,LIAM,You're good. ,2,01:07:14,,
183138,611,SAM,Okay.  I do know one piece of magic. Feast your eyes-- ,2,01:07:15,,(clears throat)
183139,612,TRAVIS,If you place a copper piece into this pot and say the magic words-- what's the magic word again? ,2,01:07:22,,
183140,613,LIAM,Fibulous. ,2,01:07:39,,
183141,614,SAM,Fibulous! It will turn into a silver piece. ,2,01:07:41,,
183142,615,LAURA,Should I say it? ,2,01:07:45,,
183143,616,TALIESIN,"I want to hear you say it, anyway. ",2,01:07:48,,
183144,617,SAM,"By the ancient order of the school, fibulous! ",2,01:07:57,,"(vocalizing, trills)"
183145,618,LIAM,That is a silver coin right there. ,2,01:08:16,,
183146,619,LAURA,Oh my gosh. Wait a minute. Does this mean the silver I won from you was actually copper? ,2,01:08:20,,
183147,620,SAM,"No, it only works up. ",2,01:08:29,,
183148,621,LAURA,Great! Thanks for the silver. ,2,01:08:32,,
183149,622,SAM,"Well, no, we weren't giving you the silver piece just showing you a bit of magic. This pot is actually quite powerful. It can do that once a day, so if you'd like to purchase it. ",2,01:08:34,,
183150,623,LAURA,Can you turn this into a gold piece? ,2,01:08:46,,
183151,624,SAM,"Well, it only works once a day. ",2,01:08:48,,
183152,625,LAURA,"Well, tomorrow can you make it gold? ",2,01:08:51,,
183153,626,SAM,I think it only does the copper to silver? ,2,01:08:54,,
183154,627,LIAM,The magic is not that strong. ,2,01:08:58,,
183155,628,SAM,"Yes, it's a mild magic pot. But if you'd like to purchase it from us, we can sell it to you for five gold. ",2,01:09:01,,
183156,629,LAURA,Five gold for one silver a day? That doesn't add up. ,2,01:09:11,,
183157,630,TRAVIS,By the end of the week you made your money back. ,2,01:09:15,,
183158,631,LAURA,No. ,2,01:09:17,,
183159,632,SAM,"At discount for friends, three gold. ",2,01:09:22,,
183160,633,LAURA,Three gold. ,2,01:09:25,,
183161,634,SAM,"And for that, we'll teach you your own magic word. ",2,01:09:29,,
183162,635,LAURA,That's pretty good. ,2,01:09:32,,
183163,636,TALIESIN,That's 40 days. ,2,01:09:35,,
183164,637,LAURA,40 days? ,2,01:09:37,,
183165,638,SAM,"You can do it once a day forever, you have it for the rest of your life. ",2,01:09:39,,
183166,639,LAURA,"Yeah, but I have lots of money. I don't need it. ",2,01:09:42,,
183167,640,SAM,"But this is free money, that you don't have to work for. ",2,01:09:45,,
183168,641,LIAM,"Also, you know, they basically helped us out today. You can do it for one, for them. ",2,01:09:47,,
183169,642,SAM,"All right, one gold. ",2,01:09:52,,
183170,643,LAURA,One gold. That's a really good deal. Did you hear how much he gave me a deal? Okay! ,2,01:09:55,,
183171,644,MATT,Do you give him the gold? ,2,01:10:05,,
183172,645,LAURA,"Yes, I'll give him the gold. Hold on, let me make sure I have it. Where's my--? ",2,01:10:07,,
183173,646,TALIESIN,It's the second button. ,2,01:10:12,,
183174,647,LAURA,"Oh, currency! Gold. Okay, one down. ",2,01:10:14,,
183175,648,MARISHA,"Do I notice anything shifty about that, while we were looking at his hands? ",2,01:10:19,,
183176,649,MATT,Perception check. ,2,01:10:23,,
183177,650,LAURA,What's my magic word? ,2,01:10:25,,
183178,651,LIAM,It can be whatever you want it to be. You have to agree upon it and you have to focus on that word for one full day while you are in possession of the pot. ,2,01:10:27,,
183179,652,MARISHA,21. ,2,01:10:34,,
183180,653,MATT,"You watch that copper piece become silver, magically. ",2,01:10:35,,
183181,654,LAURA,How about skinky doodie? ,2,01:10:40,,
183182,655,LIAM,I could consider it yours if you focused on it all day tomorrow. But you really have to focus. ,2,01:10:43,,
183183,656,LAURA,"Okay, I will. Super a lot of focus. Skinky doodie. Thank you for this. ",2,01:10:55,,
183184,657,SAM,It's a pleasure doing business with you. Does that answer your question? I've got some for you. ,2,01:11:05,,
183185,658,MARISHA,You have questions for me? ,2,01:11:10,,
183186,659,SAM,Yeah! How does someone like you -- you're human right? ,2,01:11:13,,
183187,660,MARISHA,"Yeah, I am. ",2,01:11:21,,
183188,661,SAM,How do you come by learning Halfling? ,2,01:11:22,,
183189,662,MARISHA,The wine making business. And halflings really like wine. ,2,01:11:26,,
183190,663,SAM,Everyone likes wine! ,2,01:11:38,,
183191,664,MARISHA,That's true. ,2,01:11:40,,
183192,665,TRAVIS,Some people more than others. ,2,01:11:42,,
183193,666,MARISHA,I was around it a lot. ,2,01:11:45,,
183194,667,SAM,What town was that then? ,2,01:11:58,,
183195,668,LAURA,"It's close by here, right? ",2,01:12:00,,
183196,669,MARISHA,It's a bit aways. It's Kamordah. ,2,01:12:03,,
183197,670,SAM,"Hmm, haven't heard of it. ",2,01:12:07,,
183198,671,MARISHA,"It's a small farming town, it's no big deal. It's whatever. ",2,01:12:10,,
183199,672,SAM,Nothing shady there! ,2,01:12:16,,
183200,673,MARISHA,"Nope, just a wandering traveler just like the rest of y'all. ",2,01:12:19,,
183201,674,TRAVIS,"Well I mean I was really impressed with the little trick, I sure would like to see a big trick. ",2,01:12:25,,
183202,675,LAURA,I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows! ,2,01:12:30,,
183203,676,MATT,"Being about one o'clock in the morning at this time, and the energy in the tavern has come to a quiet crawl, those who are keeping their cups are either snoring or in the process of preparing to go to sleep, you watch as Adelaine, the barmaid is walking around cleaning up tables and suddenly all the windows in the room slam open with a heavy impact and there's a burst of wind that comes through. The two crownsguard that were outside flanking the opening doorway suddenly rush and look in and look about at the lot of you. ",2,01:12:37,,
183204,677,TALIESIN,Two extra? ,2,01:13:09,,
183205,678,MATT,They both just slowly curl back to their perimeter. ,2,01:13:15,,
183206,679,TALIESIN,You're no fun. ,2,01:13:18,,
183207,680,MARISHA,"Yeah, circus! Woo, circus coming to town! ",2,01:13:20,,
183208,681,TRAVIS,"Jester, I meant a trick from Caleb. ",2,01:13:27,,
183209,682,LAURA,Oh. ,2,01:13:30,,
183210,683,LIAM,You want to see a trick? ,2,01:13:34,,
183211,684,TRAVIS,I would love one. ,2,01:13:36,,
183212,685,LIAM,"I am well into my second trost at this point. I can show you a trick. Young lady, if you would assist me please. Step up onto the table. ",2,01:13:38,,
183213,686,SAM,Absolutely! ,2,01:13:48,,
183214,687,MARISHA,Just don't break anything. ,2,01:13:50,,
183215,688,LIAM,"Adjust your minds. I begin to weave one hand in a slow circle around the other, and a globe of golden light poofs out. ",2,01:13:52,,
183216,689,SAM,I put my hands and feet out in an akimbo pose. ,2,01:14:05,,
183217,690,LIAM,A second little globule of light comes out. ,2,01:14:12,,
183218,691,SAM,I feel it coming! Hit me! ,2,01:14:15,,
183219,692,LIAM,Then two more at the same time come out of my hand. Then they amass upon my little companion and form a similar sized little humanoid of light that then coincides with my little friend. She is glowing golden on a table in the middle of the Nestled Nook. ,2,01:14:18,,
183220,693,SAM,,2,01:14:40,,(sings) 
183221,694,LIAM,"The Goblight, ladies and gentlemen. The Goblight! ",2,01:14:44,,
183222,695,SAM,Thank you! ,2,01:14:47,,
183223,696,MATT,"There's some claps in the back rooms. You see one of the drunken gentlemen has come to semi-consciousness and goes, ""That's impressive!""",2,01:14:49,,
183224,697,TRAVIS,How did you learn to do that? ,2,01:15:00,,
183225,698,LIAM,"I could always do that a little bit, as a kid. I was always good with magic. I had a knack for it. That one's easy. ",2,01:15:04,,
183226,699,TRAVIS,That's impressive. ,2,01:15:18,,
183227,700,LIAM,"Well, thank you. ",2,01:15:21,,
183228,701,MARISHA,Aw buddy. ,2,01:15:25,,
183229,702,LAURA,Maybe he can teach you how to do that. ,2,01:15:27,,
183230,703,TRAVIS,Is it something that can be taught to others? ,2,01:15:30,,
183231,704,TALIESIN,Are you trying to learn magic? Is that a thing? ,2,01:15:34,,
183232,705,TRAVIS,"Well, I'm just a little curious about how people use their magic. ",2,01:15:37,,
183233,706,MARISHA,I've seen you have a few tricks up your sleeve. You seem like you're not totally magic inept. ,2,01:15:43,,
183234,707,TRAVIS,"No, it's relatively new for me though, so I'm just trying to learn. ",2,01:15:49,,
183235,708,LIAM,Are you reading a lot? ,2,01:15:56,,
183236,709,TRAVIS,"No, I wonder if maybe I should be? ",2,01:15:58,,
183237,710,LIAM,"Well, it could be helpful. Although, I'm a bit of an amateur teacher. I taught Nott the one trick you saw, but other things. We've been working together, I suppose I could try to help you. ",2,01:16:02,,
183238,711,MARISHA,"Have you had your abilities your whole life, like a kid? ",2,01:16:17,,
183239,712,TRAVIS,"No. Again, fairly recently. ",2,01:16:21,,
183240,713,MARISHA,Something happen? ,2,01:16:27,,
183241,714,TRAVIS,Yeah. ,2,01:16:31,,
183242,715,LIAM,"Oh, I'm sorry, do you two not know each other super well? You seem like you do. ",2,01:16:34,,
183243,716,MARISHA,We got a good 24-48 hours on the rest of you. ,2,01:16:40,,
183244,717,TRAVIS,"Yeah, we're not super deep. ",2,01:16:44,,
183245,718,MARISHA,Nope. ,2,01:16:46,,
183246,719,SAM,Where did you come from then? ,2,01:16:49,,
183247,720,TRAVIS,Well I came up from the town of Port Damali. ,2,01:16:52,,
183248,721,LAURA,That's where we met! ,2,01:16:56,,
183249,722,TRAVIS,"Yeah, I met Jester a while back and after I Ieft town, coming up to the northeast, I ran across her. I'd seen her do some of her magic before. That's what I'm trying to learn about. ",2,01:16:58,,
183250,723,LAURA,"If you need anymore displays, you just let me know. ",2,01:17:10,,
183251,724,LIAM,It's good. ,2,01:17:15,,
183252,725,MARISHA,Can I request a display? I think I have a broken rib. It might be getting more purple. ,2,01:17:18,,
183253,726,LAURA,"Oh yeah, I mean I can ask, but I think I'm tapped. ",2,01:17:28,,
183254,727,MARISHA,"I'll sleep it off, it's fine. ",2,01:17:32,,
183255,728,LAURA,Yeah. I can try! I'll put my hand out. I'll try to cast Cure Wounds. I got shit. I got nothing. It's not happening. ,2,01:17:37,,
183256,729,SAM,It's past midnight! ,2,01:17:58,,
183257,730,LAURA,"Oh, no. I've got to sleep. ",2,01:17:59,,
183258,731,MATT,You concentrate for a moment. Make a medicine check. ,2,01:18:02,,
183259,732,LAURA,Okay! ,2,01:18:05,,
183260,733,SAM,Natural 12! ,2,01:18:09,,
183261,734,LAURA,That's 17. ,2,01:18:12,,
183262,735,MATT,"17. You focus on the bruised area, exposed out of her monk robes. You watch as the slight bruising suddenly turns like a sickly green. ",2,01:18:14,,
183263,736,SAM,Is that good? ,2,01:18:27,,
183264,737,MATT,In a very unhealthy way. ,2,01:18:29,,
183265,738,LAURA,You know what? I think this might be worse than just like a bruised rib. Can I poke it? Does it seem infected? ,2,01:18:34,,
183266,739,MARISHA,Does it hurt? ,2,01:18:47,,
183267,740,LAURA,"I'm not going to poke it with my finger, though, I'm going to poke at it with a fork. ",2,01:18:48,,
183268,741,MARISHA,Don't poke at me with a fork! ,2,01:18:52,,
183269,742,MATT,"Right now, she's inspecting it. You take a fork off the table and poke. ",2,01:18:57,,
183270,743,MARISHA,"No, you don't! ",2,01:19:03,,
183271,744,LAURA,"I'll use the blunt end, don't be such a baby! ",2,01:19:05,,
183272,745,MATT,"You watch as this sickly pus liquid begins to pour out, with a thick viscosity and a lot of it. You all of the sudden feel like you've punctured a balloon that's beginning to erupt and you feel awful. Then you blink a few times and it's just a bruise. You hear this distant . ",2,01:19:09,,(cackling)
183273,746,LAURA,"Oh, motherfucker, he's such a dick! ",2,01:19:33,,
183274,747,SAM,What? Who? What? What's going on? ,2,01:19:36,,
183275,748,MARISHA,My bruise is in the shape of a dick? ,2,01:19:40,,
183276,749,LAURA,That would be really cool. ,2,01:19:44,,
183277,750,MARISHA,That would be fun! ,2,01:19:45,,
183278,751,LAURA,"I'm just going make sure, I'm going to push on it a bit more. I think it's okay, you're fine. ",2,01:19:48,,
183279,752,MARISHA,All right. I'll sleep it off. ,2,01:19:53,,
183280,753,LAURA,"I think I need some sleep, you guys. ",2,01:19:56,,
183281,754,LIAM,"Gustav, the person who runs the circus, is he your friend? ",2,01:19:59,,
183282,755,TALIESIN,He's family. ,2,01:20:04,,
183283,756,LIAM,He's family? ,2,01:20:06,,
183284,757,TALIESIN,We take care of each other. He's a good man. ,2,01:20:07,,
183285,758,LIAM,So what's your play tomorrow? ,2,01:20:09,,
183286,759,TALIESIN,"Well, they have all my things and they have all my family. I'm going to figure out what is going on. Try and find out what's actually doing this. I assume since it's none of us, it's going to happen again. ",2,01:20:12,,
183287,760,LAURA,But how can we because we can't leave this tavern? ,2,01:20:27,,
183288,761,TALIESIN,"Well, I-- ",2,01:20:31,,
183289,762,SAM,Were Caleb and I not instructed not to leave the tavern? We received no formal instruction. ,2,01:20:35,,
183290,763,MATT,"No, you weren't part of that formal instruction. The rest of you were told not to leave the tavern until further notice. ",2,01:20:40,,
183291,764,TALIESIN,"I'm sure if we sleep on it, we'll think of something. ",2,01:20:44,,
183292,765,LAURA,Fjord! You and I could leave in the morning the same way we got in. ,2,01:20:46,,
183293,766,TRAVIS,That's true. ,2,01:20:51,,
183294,767,SAM,How'd you get in? ,2,01:20:53,,
183295,768,LAURA,"With magic. I would show you now, but I'm out of spells! ",2,01:20:54,,
183296,769,SAM,"The fork trick wasn't very fun, was it? ",2,01:21:00,,
183297,770,LAURA,I thought she might be. ,2,01:21:03,,
183298,771,TALIESIN,That's fair. ,2,01:21:08,,
183299,772,LAURA,"She got clawed, right? ",2,01:21:10,,
183300,773,TALIESIN,"A bit, yeah. ",2,01:21:11,,
183301,774,LAURA,"All right. Hey bitches, I'm going to go to bed. ",2,01:21:12,,
183302,775,TALIESIN,"Where exactly am I going to be sleeping, by the way? I can sleep down here, but it might be nice-- ",2,01:21:17,,
183303,776,TRAVIS,"Molly, if you would like to share my room, you can. ",2,01:21:26,,
183304,777,TALIESIN,Excellent. You don't mind? I'm going to pull the swords off finally and start getting comfortable out of the performance clothes. ,2,01:21:30,,
183305,778,MARISHA,Sleeping on the floor on my bedroll. ,2,01:21:41,,
183306,779,LAURA,"As she starts to go to sleep, I want to draw in my sketchbook and tell the Traveler all about the cool things I saw for the day. I'm going to draw the red faced guard as I pretended I was a zombie, and I'm going to draw Molly's horns all full of jewels and stuff! I'm going to draw the stack of books. ",2,01:21:47,,
183307,780,SAM,The monster attack? ,2,01:22:14,,
183308,781,LAURA,"And I'm going to draw like a zombie, but like as an old man but as he's biting his dentures fall out and he's not no teeth! ",2,01:22:17,,
183309,782,MATT,"The rest of you, go to your respective rooms and find yourselves falling into a night's rest. As evening comes to a close and the morning brings you to consciousness, you are rested. You are healed up, your spells are restored. ",2,01:22:28,,
183310,783,SAM,I can use the Long Rest feature of D&D Beyond! ,2,01:22:48,,
183311,784,MARISHA,You hit a button! ,2,01:22:51,,
183312,785,LAURA,And all my spells back! ,2,01:22:55,,
183313,786,TALIESIN,There is a button for it. ,2,01:22:56,,
183314,787,SAM,,2,01:22:57,,(laughter) 
183315,788,TRAVIS,"D&D Beyond's watching going, ""Fuck you, Nott!"" ",2,01:23:11,,
183316,789,LAURA,"Wait no, you're putting temporary hit points on! What are you doing? ",2,01:23:15,,
183317,790,SAM,We'll work on this during the break. ,2,01:23:19,,
183318,791,LIAM,"Self destruct in 10, nine. ",2,01:23:23,,
183319,792,MARISHA,He just throws the iPad. ,2,01:23:27,,
183320,793,MATT,It's probably 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning at this point in time and the day is yours. What do you wish to do? ,2,01:23:29,,
183321,794,MARISHA,"As I wake up, I sit up and I go: Jester? ",2,01:23:48,,
183322,795,LAURA,Hmm? ,2,01:23:52,,
183323,796,MARISHA,Were you laughing to yourself last night? I just kept hearing giggling. It was obnoxious. ,2,01:23:54,,
183324,797,LAURA,I'm sorry. ,2,01:24:02,,
183325,798,MARISHA,Uh-huh. I just get ready. ,2,01:24:03,,
183326,799,MATT,"As a note, too, for all the drinks you guys drank last night, that probably put you back about one and a half gold. ",2,01:24:08,,
183327,800,TRAVIS,"Molly, that's your tab, right? ",2,01:24:13,,
183328,801,TALIESIN,All but the one you bought me. ,2,01:24:16,,
183329,802,TRAVIS,"Yeah, except for that one. ",2,01:24:19,,
183330,803,TALIESIN,"To be fair, I didn't give you that story. ",2,01:24:23,,
183331,804,TRAVIS,That's true. ,2,01:24:26,,
183332,805,TALIESIN,I very carefully start unfolding my robe and it has my swords very carefully laid out in there from the closet. I do a little prayer and put everything back on. ,2,01:24:29,,
183333,806,TRAVIS,Are you praying over your swords? ,2,01:24:41,,
183334,807,TALIESIN,"I am, of course. ",2,01:24:44,,
183335,808,TRAVIS,Is that part of your thing? ,2,01:24:46,,
183336,809,TALIESIN,You seem honest. ,2,01:24:52,,
183337,810,TRAVIS,I try to be. ,2,01:24:54,,
183338,811,TALIESIN,"Our family, and I take this with a grain of salt, were royal guards, were entrusted with these magic swords and these swords can only be activated by the blood of the royal family. So in honor of any fighting I ever do with them, I make sure my blood is at least drawn once. ",2,01:24:55,,
183339,812,TRAVIS,That's quite the story. Can I insight check him? ,2,01:25:36,,
183340,813,MATT,"Yes, you may. ",2,01:25:39,,
183341,814,TRAVIS,15. ,2,01:25:43,,
183342,815,TALIESIN,What am I fighting against? ,2,01:25:44,,
183343,816,MATT,This would be deception. ,2,01:25:46,,
183344,817,TALIESIN,That would be deception. All right. I'm lying like a motherfucker. ,2,01:25:48,,
183345,818,TRAVIS,Well thank you for sharing that honest story with me. It means a lot. ,2,01:25:56,,
183346,819,TALIESIN,I walk downstairs. ,2,01:26:06,,
183347,820,MATT,All right. ,2,01:26:08,,
183348,821,LAURA,Can I go knock on Fjord's door? ,2,01:26:09,,
183349,822,MATT,Sure. ,2,01:26:11,,
183350,823,LAURA,"Ey oh ey, good morning! ",2,01:26:13,,
183351,824,SAM,She's a morning person too? Jesus. ,2,01:26:17,,
183352,825,TRAVIS,,2,01:26:21,,(laughter) 
183353,826,LAURA,"Hey, do you want to get out of here? ",2,01:26:29,,
183354,827,TRAVIS,"Yeah, we said we were going to do that, didn't we? What did you have in mind? ",2,01:26:32,,
183355,828,LAURA,"Well, we sneak out and then we go find out why there are zombies. ",2,01:26:36,,
183356,829,TRAVIS,That's a detailed plan. ,2,01:26:41,,
183357,830,LAURA,Yes. ,2,01:26:42,,
183358,831,TRAVIS,I like it. Are we taking anybody with us? ,2,01:26:44,,
183359,832,LAURA,"Well, if they can make themselves not look like themselves, then sure. ",2,01:26:46,,
183360,833,TRAVIS,Fair enough. Do you want to ask any of them? ,2,01:26:49,,
183361,834,LAURA,"Hey, Beau. ",2,01:26:53,,
183362,835,MARISHA,Yeah. ,2,01:26:54,,
183363,836,LAURA,Do you have anything you can do to make yourself not look like you? ,2,01:26:56,,
183364,837,MARISHA,I take my robes and I flip them inside out and I take some dirt and dirty it up a little bit and take my hair down and I steal a scarf off of Jester's stuff and I do a bandana around my head. ,2,01:27:03,,
183365,838,LAURA,"No, you look like you with a bandana around your head. ",2,01:27:21,,
183366,839,TRAVIS,"Yeah that's not going to cut it, not quite like what we had in mind. ",2,01:27:24,,
183367,840,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,01:27:28,,
183368,841,MARISHA,What are you guys doing? You guys leaving? Are you guys fucking leaving? You're not leaving without me are you? ,2,01:27:29,,
183369,842,LAURA,"No, of course, we're coming back. ",2,01:27:34,,
183370,843,MARISHA,You're skipping town. ,2,01:27:36,,
183371,844,LAURA,"No. Oh, but we could. ",2,01:27:37,,
183372,845,TRAVIS,She's right here. ,2,01:27:39,,
183373,846,LAURA,Okay. ,2,01:27:40,,
183374,847,MARISHA,"I could skip town with you, though. Do you want to skip town? ",2,01:27:42,,
183375,848,LAURA,We'll be back. ,2,01:27:44,,
183376,849,TRAVIS,Let's see if Caleb and his little friend are downstairs first. He has tricks after all. ,2,01:27:50,,
183377,850,LAURA,Right. ,2,01:27:56,,
183378,851,MATT,What are you up to? ,2,01:27:58,,
183379,852,SAM,"Get some breakfast, I guess? ",2,01:28:03,,
183380,853,LIAM,"Yeah, we're already down there. ",2,01:28:04,,
183381,854,MATT,You've already gone down there? ,2,01:28:06,,
183382,855,TALIESIN,I'm leaving a note with the barkeep for Yasha if she comes back. ,2,01:28:07,,
183383,856,MATT,Okay. ,2,01:28:12,,
183384,857,MARISHA,I guess I go down and have breakfast as well. ,2,01:28:13,,
183385,858,MATT,As you guys wander down you find Caleb and Nott already at a table and Mollymauk returning from the bar after delivering that note. ,2,01:28:16,,
183386,859,TRAVIS,Y'all are downstairs? ,2,01:28:26,,
183387,860,SAM,,2,01:28:27,,(messy eating noises) 
183388,861,LAURA,Can I try to pick a piece of bacon off your plate? ,2,01:28:32,,
183389,862,SAM,"Sure, for you. ",2,01:28:34,,(growls)
183390,863,LAURA,Thanks. ,2,01:28:37,,
183391,864,TRAVIS,"It's like a little dog. The little back foot creeps up.  If we could we're-- did you just fucking? Shit. We were thinking of maybe finding our way outside of the inn for a bit. I don't want to presume anything, but do you have the ability to change the way you look? ",2,01:28:40,,(growls)
183392,865,LIAM,To change the way I look? ,2,01:29:11,,
183393,866,TRAVIS,Yeah. You know ,2,01:29:13,,
183394,867,LIAM,To leave the inn? ,2,01:29:15,,
183395,868,TRAVIS,"Yeah, assume a different form. ",2,01:29:16,,
183396,869,LIAM,Why would I do that to leave the inn? ,2,01:29:17,,
183397,870,LAURA,So we can find out why there are zombies. ,2,01:29:18,,
183398,871,LIAM,Why wouldn't I just walk out of the inn? ,2,01:29:20,,
183399,872,LAURA,"Well, because we were told we can't leave the inn. ",2,01:29:23,,
183400,873,SAM,We weren't told that. ,2,01:29:25,,
183401,874,TRAVIS,Right. ,2,01:29:27,,
183402,875,LAURA,"Huh. Well, that's convenient. ",2,01:29:29,,
183403,876,SAM,But I can change my appearance. ,2,01:29:31,,
183404,877,LAURA,Wow. I would never know it was you. ,2,01:29:35,,
183405,878,SAM,Yeah. ,2,01:29:38,,
183406,879,TRAVIS,"Molly, what about you? ",2,01:29:42,,
183407,880,TALIESIN,"Well, I mean look at me. I go into my bag. I do have a disguise kit. Don't I? I think I do. It's so weird to just have things now. Yeah, I have a disguise kit. ",2,01:29:45,,
183408,881,TRAVIS,Fair enough. ,2,01:30:04,,
183409,882,SAM,What does that mean? ,2,01:30:05,,
183410,883,MATT,It means he can use to try and disguise himself. Hide features. ,2,01:30:07,,
183411,884,TALIESIN,But the rest of you could do a little work. ,2,01:30:11,,
183412,885,TRAVIS,"Beau, I don't want to leave you behind, but I-- ",2,01:30:17,,
183413,886,LAURA,"It's true. I have a disguise kit, too. I could help you out. ",2,01:30:20,,
183414,887,MARISHA,Would you do my makeup for me? ,2,01:30:23,,
183415,888,LAURA,I'm really good at makeup. ,2,01:30:26,,
183416,889,MARISHA,Are you? ,2,01:30:28,,
183417,890,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,01:30:29,,
183418,891,MARISHA,Let's do that. ,2,01:30:29,,
183419,892,LAURA,,2,01:30:30,,(laughter) 
183420,893,TALIESIN,We could just shower this one that would be enough. ,2,01:30:34,,
183421,894,LAURA,"He can leave, apparently. ",2,01:30:37,,
183422,895,LIAM,"Yeah, we could. But not town, we were told to stay in town. ",2,01:30:40,,
183423,896,LAURA,"No, no, we're going to stay in town. ",2,01:30:44,,
183424,897,SAM,What are we doing again? ,2,01:30:47,,
183425,898,LAURA,We have to find out why there are zombies so we that don't get arrested for being zombies. ,2,01:30:48,,
183426,899,SAM,So we solve the case to clear our own name. ,2,01:30:52,,
183427,900,LIAM,Why shouldn't we just wait for it all to blow over? We didn't do anything. ,2,01:30:58,,
183428,901,TALIESIN,I tend to find these things don't blow over necessarily as more they just eventually decide someone's guilty and take their revenge on them. ,2,01:31:05,,
183429,902,LIAM,Do you find yourself in situations like this often? ,2,01:31:12,,
183430,903,TALIESIN,"Not this particular one, but yes. ",2,01:31:14,,
183431,904,MARISHA,"I mean, look at him. No offense or anything. ",2,01:31:16,,
183432,905,TALIESIN,"None taken, really. A little taken, but that's fine. ",2,01:31:19,,
183433,906,TRAVIS,"He makes a point. I think that the sooner we find the cause of this, the sooner we can get out of here. ",2,01:31:24,,
183434,907,TALIESIN,"She's right, immediately the two of us are going to get hit with this. ",2,01:31:30,,
183435,908,SAM,It's not a terrible plan. ,2,01:31:34,,
183436,909,MARISHA,And you're so concerned with your goblin friend. I mean he's in the same boat as the tieflings. ,2,01:31:39,,
183437,910,LIAM,That's a girl. ,2,01:31:44,,
183438,911,LAURA,I know it's hard to tell. ,2,01:31:46,,
183439,912,MARISHA,I said your goblin friend. ,2,01:31:47,,
183440,913,"LAURA, LAURA",You said he. ,2,01:31:49,,
183441,914,MARISHA,Whatever. ,2,01:31:50,,
183442,915,SAM,"Listen, we've all had a rough night. I know that my features aren't necessarily the most feminine. Among goblin kind, I understand. It's hard to tell. ",2,01:31:52,,
183443,916,LAURA,I can tell. ,2,01:32:08,,
183444,917,LIAM,Everybody can tell. ,2,01:32:09,,
183445,918,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,01:32:11,,
183446,919,MARISHA,I'm working on it. ,2,01:32:13,,
183447,920,TRAVIS,"Let's get out of here. Can I walk back into a privy, washroom area? ",2,01:32:16,,
183448,921,MATT,"Yeah, upstairs at the very end of the hall is the communal washroom. ",2,01:32:23,,
183449,922,TRAVIS,Can I use my Mask of Many Faces to cast Disguise Self on myself? ,2,01:32:27,,
183450,923,MATT,"Sure, what form so you want to take? ",2,01:32:32,,
183451,924,TRAVIS,"Older, white-haired, with a beard. Just very simple peasant's clothes. Maybe a bit of a farmer or a land worker. ",2,01:32:34,,
183452,925,MATT,"Okay, easily enough. Basic browns and tans and general farm worker's tunic and supplies. ",2,01:32:43,,
183453,926,TRAVIS,"Smudges, dirt on the fingernails. ",2,01:32:52,,
183454,927,MATT,"Yeah, easy enough. ",2,01:32:53,,
183455,928,LAURA,I'm going to help Beau. You know what I'm going to do for you? I'm going to use my disguise kit I'm going to give you a beard. ,2,01:32:55,,
183456,929,MARISHA,"Oh, yeah! ",2,01:33:03,,
183457,930,LAURA,"Yeah and I'm going to turn you into a dude, that's a good disguise, right? ",2,01:33:04,,
183458,931,MARISHA,Love it. ,2,01:33:15,,
183459,932,SAM,"You really have to sell it though, and act like a dude. ",2,01:33:17,,
183460,933,MARISHA,I think I can do that. ,2,01:33:21,,"(low, gravelly voice)"
183461,934,SAM,Oh yes! ,2,01:33:24,,
183462,935,MARISHA,"I'm going to go a step further and tape down my boobs, bandage them down all the way, you know wrap them. Stuff my crotch a little bit. ",2,01:33:26,,
183463,936,MATT,All right. Go ahead and make a dexterity check. ,2,01:33:36,,
183464,937,TALIESIN,Do you want assistance with this? ,2,01:33:40,,
183465,938,LAURA,Was he helping me? ,2,01:33:44,,
183466,939,MATT,If you want to. ,2,01:33:47,,
183467,940,LAURA,Sure. ,2,01:33:48,,
183468,941,MATT,So take it with advantage. ,2,01:33:49,,
183469,942,TALIESIN,"Oh, with advantage. ",2,01:33:51,,
183470,943,LAURA,15. ,2,01:33:52,,
183471,944,MATT,"15, okay. You actually manage to sell a decent disguise. ",2,01:34:02,,
183472,945,MARISHA,Do I have some five o'clock shadow? ,2,01:34:06,,
183473,946,MATT,"At a distance, at like three or four feet would be passable and walking quickly by. Upon close inspection, you could see through it. ",2,01:34:08,,
183474,947,LIAM,Is it like one of those old kids toys where you use the magnet to pull the little filings up? ,2,01:34:17,,
183475,948,MATT,More or less. ,2,01:34:21,,
183476,949,MARISHA,Mr. Woolly? ,2,01:34:22,,
183477,950,MATT,A medieval version of that. ,2,01:34:24,,
183478,951,LIAM,Herr Woolly. ,2,01:34:27,,
183479,952,MATT,But impressive. Using the kit and using whatever scraps of clothing you can find and amass you manage to get a relatively top-knot Silverlake hobo version of Beau functionally ready to go. ,2,01:34:28,,
183480,953,LAURA,"It's good, it's good. ",2,01:34:41,,
183481,954,MARISHA,"Wait Fjord how do you sound? Say words, you're manly. ",2,01:34:44,,
183482,955,"TRAVIS, MARISHA",,2,01:34:49,,(laughter) 
183483,956,LAURA,"And I'll cast Disguise Self on myself, as well, and turn myself into a human with blonde hair and she's going to be very clean-looking. ",2,01:35:01,,
183484,957,SAM,Angelina. ,2,01:35:23,,
183485,958,LAURA,"Yes! With big lips, and a couple jewels on her fingers. ",2,01:35:26,,
183486,959,MATT,"Okay. Just double-checking here, Disguise Self lasts for, is it an hour? Yeah, I thought it was an hour. So while they're doing that, are you using your disguise kit on yourself? ",2,01:35:35,,
183487,960,TALIESIN,I assume I've just got some very basic black robe that just-- ,2,01:35:47,,
183488,961,MATT,"Yeah, with a cloak and hood and make-up, you can probably pass for human as long as you keep the hood up, and keep most of your more ostentatious garb hidden. ",2,01:35:53,,
183489,962,TALIESIN,I'm sure I've got a set. ,2,01:36:01,,
183490,963,MATT,Go ahead and make a dexterity check for your disguise kit. ,2,01:36:03,,
183491,964,LAURA,Do you want help? ,2,01:36:06,,
183492,965,TALIESIN,"Yes please, this is a lot of work. It's a natural 20, that'll do it. ",2,01:36:07,,
183493,966,MATT,"All right. Between making your skin tone more of a natural tan, peach humanoid color, bring the hood up. You actually pull some of your hair forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the front. You manage to tuck in and tie your robe behind you, your usual clothing, and then using an over-robe to hide most of the material, and you look like a dude passing through. So with that your disguises are complete, your spells are cast. ",2,01:36:12,,
183494,967,MARISHA,Is that your human face? ,2,01:36:45,,
183495,968,LIAM,"While they're doing all that, I want to stroll outside and see if there's crownsguard outside, or what. I'm just going to get a breath of fresh air and see what's on the street outside of this place. ",2,01:36:49,,
183496,969,MATT,"Okay. As you exit, there are two gentlemen in full crownsguard gear. One is standing outside, the other is currently sitting in a chair, and as soon as you walk past, they both scan you up and down, continue to watch you pass by. ",2,01:36:58,,
183497,970,LIAM,Good. There's only just the two at the door? ,2,01:37:11,,
183498,971,MATT,"Just the two that you can see at the front, yes. ",2,01:37:15,,
183499,972,LIAM,"Okay, all right. So I just take a minute or two. I go back inside. And-- on Nott's shoulder and say we're good, yeah, I think we're good. ",2,01:37:17,,
183500,973,SAM,Excellent. ,2,01:37:26,,
183501,974,LAURA,"Should we try to do this, then? ",2,01:37:28,,
183502,975,TRAVIS,"In twos, or singles. ",2,01:37:30,,
183503,976,LAURA,"Yeah, of course, not all at the same time, that's obvious. ",2,01:37:32,,
183504,977,TRAVIS,"Level two, trying to get out of a fucking inn. ",2,01:37:35,,
183505,978,MARISHA,It's so hard. ,2,01:37:38,,
183506,979,TALIESIN,Now I'm kicking myself. ,2,01:37:39,,
183507,980,MARISHA,So anxiety-inducing. ,2,01:37:41,,
183508,981,TALIESIN,"No, never mind, I didn't do it at the time, I can't do it now. No retconning, never mind. ",2,01:37:43,,
183509,982,LIAM,"I'm going to squat down over with you, privately. I still think that this is a bad idea, but I can tell that you want to. ",2,01:37:48,,
183510,983,SAM,"Well it's just that-- listen, there's no offense, I enjoy our talks and your schooling and everything, but I haven't talked this openly and freely with other people in months. It's amazing. ",2,01:37:57,,
183511,984,LIAM,"It really is pretty nice, isn't it? ",2,01:38:13,,
183512,985,SAM,Yes! ,2,01:38:15,,
183513,986,LIAM,"Still, if this goes south, we leave. ",2,01:38:17,,
183514,987,SAM,We're the first ones out the door. ,2,01:38:19,,
183515,988,LIAM,Easily. ,2,01:38:21,,
183516,989,SAM,Yeah. They'll never know who we were. ,2,01:38:22,,
183517,990,LIAM,Caleb and Nott. ,2,01:38:25,,
183518,991,SAM,"Well, don't say that too much. I mean, yes, they do know that we're Caleb and Nott, yes. ",2,01:38:26,,
183519,992,LIAM,All right. ,2,01:38:31,,
183520,993,SAM,Okay. ,2,01:38:32,,
183521,994,LIAM,So we're doing this? ,2,01:38:33,,
183522,995,SAM,"Yeah, let's just go with, and see where it leads. ",2,01:38:34,,
183523,996,LAURA,Can I walk up to Nott? ,2,01:38:38,,
183524,997,SAM,"Hi! Yes, we weren't talking! ",2,01:38:40,,
183525,998,LAURA,Do you like my outfit? ,2,01:38:43,,(high-pitched)
183526,999,SAM,"Oh! What are you? I'm sorry, I'm just a young girl from the village. ",2,01:38:44,,
183527,1000,LAURA,And I'm just a young girl from town. ,2,01:38:50,,
183528,1001,SAM,I don't know anything. I should go get my father. ,2,01:38:54,,
183529,1002,TRAVIS,,2,01:38:58,,(high-pitched) New York is where I'd rather stay! (laughter) 
183530,1003,LAURA,"Nott, it's me! It's Jester! ",2,01:39:06,,
183531,1004,SAM,But you look like-- ,2,01:39:10,,
183532,1005,LAURA,I know! This is how good I am at magic! Check me out. Are we leaving here or not? ,2,01:39:12,,
183533,1006,SAM,Are you afraid you'll be propositioned on the street? ,2,01:39:19,,
183534,1007,LAURA,I am really attractive right now. ,2,01:39:23,,
183535,1008,SAM,Those lips are very big. ,2,01:39:25,,
183536,1009,LAURA,I came over here to give you the blessing! ,2,01:39:29,,
183537,1010,SAM,What is that? What does that do? ,2,01:39:31,,
183538,1011,LAURA,It helps you with your stealthing! ,2,01:39:33,,
183539,1012,SAM,"Oh, the stealthy thing, yes, thank you so much, I'll accept it. ",2,01:39:35,,
183540,1013,LAURA,"You're welcome. Okay, that's it. But I'll see you outside at some point, okay? Don't be scared, come up to me. ",2,01:39:38,,
183541,1014,"SAM, LAURA",Okay. ,2,01:39:42,,
183542,1015,MATT,"Okay, in what order are you leaving? ",2,01:39:44,,
183543,1016,TRAVIS,Should I go first? ,2,01:39:46,,
183544,1017,LAURA,Sure! ,2,01:39:47,,
183545,1018,MARISHA,Are we going out in pairs? Like you said?  Are we going out in pairs? ,2,01:39:48,,(Deeper)
183546,1019,TALIESIN,Has Adelaine noticed any of this? ,2,01:39:53,,
183547,1020,MATT,"Other than that, no one immediately seems to be noticing. Make a perception check. ",2,01:39:56,,
183548,1021,TRAVIS,Not command ops in the tavern hall. ,2,01:40:06,,
183549,1022,TALIESIN,Let's call that a-- ,2,01:40:08,,
183550,1023,LAURA,14! ,2,01:40:12,,
183551,1024,TALIESIN,"14, thank you. ",2,01:40:13,,
183552,1025,MATT,"You do see Yorda, the barkeep, in the process of wiping out some glasses at the end, she's occasionally giving a glance over to you guys as you're walking around. ",2,01:40:15,,
183553,1026,LAURA,You go first! ,2,01:40:31,,(whispering)
183554,1027,TRAVIS,You want to come with? ,2,01:40:33,,
183555,1028,MARISHA,Yeah. ,2,01:40:35,,
183556,1029,TRAVIS,"Don't do anything stupid. Mouth shut, eyes forward. Show me how you walk. Maybe a little less. That's nice. I also assume a little limp, slight. ",2,01:40:38,,
183557,1030,MATT,"I'll say for the purpose of this, each of you make a performance check. ",2,01:40:57,,
183558,1031,LAURA,"Oh, god. ",2,01:41:01,,
183559,1032,TRAVIS,20. ,2,01:41:08,,
183560,1033,MARISHA,16. ,2,01:41:13,,
183561,1034,MATT,"Okay. The both of you exit out, holding your breath. Out of your peripheral you can see the deep reds and golds of the crownsguard armor flanking you as you breach the outer porch of the tavern, stepping down into the dust to the main street. You curve to the left and see nor hear any reaction from either of them. ",2,01:41:15,,
183562,1035,TRAVIS,Just keep moving to the other side of the street. ,2,01:41:42,,
183563,1036,TALIESIN,"I go single just a little bit after, and I rolled a natural 20. ",2,01:41:44,,
183564,1037,SAM,Is that three for the night? ,2,01:41:49,,
183565,1038,TALIESIN,Yep. ,2,01:41:50,,
183566,1039,SAM,Oh my god. ,2,01:41:51,,
183567,1040,TRAVIS,What color is that die? ,2,01:41:52,,
183568,1041,TALIESIN,"It seems to be iron, like my will. ",2,01:41:53,,
183569,1042,MATT,"It may not have been the snitch after all, you asshole. ",2,01:42:00,,
183570,1043,TALIESIN,Me and my magic swords. ,2,01:42:05,,
183571,1044,MATT,"Apparently. All right, you saunter by without an issue. By saunter, I mean you stumble through. You hear a cough at one point, and it causes you a moment, but you just continue on without notice. ",2,01:42:07,,
183572,1045,LAURA,"Oh, everybody's leaving and I didn't have a partner! ",2,01:42:20,,
183573,1046,MARISHA,"It's fine, don't worry about it. ",2,01:42:23,,
183574,1047,SAM,"You can come with us, if you like. ",2,01:42:25,,
183575,1048,LAURA,But I feel like you guys are noticeable and why would I be this really beautiful woman leaving with the stinky guy? ,2,01:42:28,,
183576,1049,SAM,It's quickly becoming canon that you just have shit smeared all over you. You could travel with me! I could be your daughter. ,2,01:42:37,,
183577,1050,LAURA,You're my daughter! ,2,01:42:53,,
183578,1051,SAM,"Yes! We're a couple, and he's our guard or something, I don't know. ",2,01:42:54,,
183579,1052,LAURA,"Yeah! You leave after us Caleb, okay? ",2,01:43:01,,
183580,1053,LIAM,Isn't it simpler for you to walk on yourself like a beautiful woman? ,2,01:43:05,,
183581,1054,LAURA,"Okay, come on, Nott! ",2,01:43:07,,
183582,1055,SAM,"I'm sorry, she's very forward. ",2,01:43:09,,
183583,1056,LAURA,"Come on sweetie, let's go. ",2,01:43:12,,
183584,1057,SAM,"Yes, mommy! ",2,01:43:14,,
183585,1058,LAURA,And we walk out. ,2,01:43:15,,
183586,1059,MATT,"You guys don't have to make a performance check because you've exited before, and you're completely visually a different individual, so you guys pass through without an issue. Caleb, you can follow up behind, as you are not currently under direct guard in the tavern. They do notice you exit, and they're aware of your presence, but you are not confined to the tavern. So you guys all manage to slowly come together a few blocks down and out of the sight of the crownsguard guarding the Nestled Nook Inn, and where are you off to? ",2,01:43:18,,
183587,1060,LAURA,We did it! Where should we go? ,2,01:43:48,,
183588,1061,TRAVIS,Let's just keep walking for now. ,2,01:43:51,,
183589,1062,LAURA,Okay. Should we walk toward the carnival where the zombies were? ,2,01:43:53,,
183590,1063,TALIESIN,"Who was he, would be my question. ",2,01:43:58,,
183591,1064,LAURA,"Oh, right. We should find out where he's from. How do we do that? Should we ask around and say hey, anybody know where the old guy came from that turned into a zombie? ",2,01:44:02,,
183592,1065,TRAVIS,That's a good point. ,2,01:44:13,,
183593,1066,TALIESIN,Seems to be the most appropriate thing to ask at this point. ,2,01:44:14,,
183594,1067,LIAM,"Well, we could find some public places and just gossip a bit, see if anybody has heard of him, if a friend has died at the circus last night. ",2,01:44:17,,

Where did that rule come from? The sick makes sense, I asked you that before, but why elderly? ",2,02:01:28,,
183783,1256,TALIESIN,That rule's been around for as long as I can remember because it makes people think the show's dangerous. Gives them a thrill. ,2,02:01:50,,
183784,1257,TRAVIS,You're worried about them having a heart attack or something? ,2,02:01:58,,
183785,1258,TALIESIN,"We're not really worried about people having a heart attack; we want people to be worried about having a heart attack, because then they're more excited to come see the show. This is how these shows work. ",2,02:02:01,,
183786,1259,MARISHA,Do you know who implemented that rule? ,2,02:02:10,,
183787,1260,TALIESIN,Before my time. ,2,02:02:12,,
183788,1261,LAURA,"In his defense, every carnival I've gone to has said no sick people, no old people. ",2,02:02:14,,
183789,1262,TALIESIN,It's a boilerplate. ,2,02:02:20,,
183790,1263,MARISHA,Still a good candidate. ,2,02:02:24,,
183791,1264,TALIESIN,"If you were trying to hide doing something to someone it's a great candidate. If I was trying to get away with something, terrible idea. ",2,02:02:27,,
183792,1265,MARISHA,"Seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this town who don't like tieflings and other strange lots. Jester, you actually said one of the smartest things of the night, which is-- you did, yeah. Which is, guard's really weird. ",2,02:02:34,,
183793,1266,LAURA,Right? ,2,02:02:57,,
183794,1267,MARISHA,Yeah. ,2,02:02:58,,
183795,1268,TALIESIN,"Wait, what? ",2,02:02:59,,
183796,1269,LAURA,The guards are really weird. ,2,02:03:00,,
183797,1270,MARISHA,"The Crownsguards. As you were saying, the Ustaloch? ",2,02:03:02,,
183798,1271,TALIESIN,What kind of weird? ,2,02:03:06,,
183799,1272,LAURA,"Like, you know, they-- What kind of weird? ",2,02:03:07,,(laughter) 
183800,1273,MARISHA,"They seem to be the one connecting through-line. Also, what's her name, Norda? Mentioned that she didn't want to let you lot in, but made an exception. I don't know, if I wanted to do something, and if I already knew a bunch of people were upset and angry at a circus and strange people coming in, it's easy framing, in my opinion. ",2,02:03:14,,
183801,1274,TRAVIS,Bingo. ,2,02:03:57,,
183802,1275,MARISHA,"That, or if you're up to no good and you don't want to get caught, blame it on the easy frame. The weirdos who just rolled into town. ",2,02:03:59,,
183803,1276,LAURA,"Great, so we just need to investigate the guards. ",2,02:04:08,,
183804,1277,TRAVIS,That might be harder to do. Maybe we go down to the Lochward. ,2,02:04:13,,
183805,1278,TALIESIN,"Start at the docks, but I'll keep that in mind. ",2,02:04:16,,

183807,1280,LAURA,Do we need to question the guards? ,2,02:04:22,,
183808,1281,SAM,That sounds terrible. ,2,02:04:25,,
183809,1282,LAURA,Maybe we should tell them they can't leave town. ,2,02:04:26,,
183810,1283,MARISHA,"Ooh, that's a good idea, yeah! Maybe when they question us-- ",2,02:04:29,,

183818,1291,TRAVIS,How far is it from where we are to the Lochward? ,2,02:04:47,,
183819,1292,MATT,It's a quick jaunt over to the edge of the Ustaloch. ,2,02:04:49,,
183820,1293,MARISHA,"So the Ustaloch is the docks? It's what they called the ward, or it's the lake? ",2,02:04:55,,
183821,1294,MATT,"It's the giant lake that the docks are up against. The city is built against this giant, kidney bean-shaped lake. ",2,02:05:01,,
183822,1295,MARISHA,"What does ""usta"" mean? What does ""usta"" come from? ",2,02:05:05,,

183830,1303,MATT,I just wanted to fuck with you. ,2,02:05:19,,
183831,1304,LIAM,"It's been a while, but osten means lake. No, it's not Lake Lake. ",2,02:05:21,,
183832,1305,MATT,"Essentially, it just means ""an east lake."" ",2,02:05:26,,
183833,1306,"LIAM, MARISHA",East Lake. ,2,02:05:28,,
183834,1307,TALIESIN,Very good. ,2,02:05:31,,

183836,1309,MARISHA,All right. ,2,02:05:35,,
183837,1310,TALIESIN,I'd like to avoid the guards for as long as possible. ,2,02:05:37,,
183838,1311,MARISHA,Agreed. ,2,02:05:41,,

You approach, and the first couple of fishermen that walk past you both look to be hardened in their years.

183960,1433,SAM,We are the best detectives ever. ,2,02:32:04,,
183961,1434,LAURA,I feel like we are really doing bad at this detective thing. ,2,02:32:08,,
183962,1435,TRAVIS,We should probably wrap up whatever we're doing. I imagine they're going to come by the inn soon and try and speak with us. Not you two. ,2,02:32:11,,
183963,1436,SAM,We didn't leave any sort of Ferris Bueller-y thing? ,2,02:32:18,,

183965,1438,MATT,What are you guys doing? Where are you going? ,2,02:32:29,,
183966,1439,SAM,Is there anywhere else that we need to inspect? The carnival or more docks stuff? ,2,02:32:31,,
183967,1440,LAURA,I feel like going back to the carnival is probably a bad idea. ,2,02:32:36,,
183968,1441,TALIESIN,"I'd say the docks are his home, if we could figure out where he lived. ",2,02:32:39,,

183979,1452,SAM,But he's not trying to investigate! ,2,02:33:13,,
183980,1453,TALIESIN,I take the compliment. I'm putting it my pocket. I'm keeping it for later. ,2,02:33:18,,
183981,1454,MATT,He climbs back up the ladder to the roof. ,2,02:33:21,,
183982,1455,MARISHA,I'm starting to think that following Enon's story isn't necessarily going to lead us here. He seems like a random victim. ,2,02:33:23,,
183983,1456,LAURA,"Hey, 14 year old kid! ",2,02:33:31,,
183984,1457,MATT,"He has this puffy red 'fro going on. He looks pale, fresh to this, scrawny. He's stopped drawing his blade across the snake. ""Yeah?"" ",2,02:33:34,,

184004,1477,SAM,We are really terrible at this! ,2,02:35:23,,
184005,1478,TALIESIN,"Well, she's making friends with everybody. I don't see any of you making friends. ",2,02:35:26,,
184006,1479,TRAVIS,I'm a little concerned that we've been gone for a while. ,2,02:35:29,,
184007,1480,MARISHA,"Yeah, maybe we should get back. ",2,02:35:31,,
184008,1481,TRAVIS,"Maybe let these two, that aren't under house arrest-- ",2,02:35:32,,
184009,1482,SAM,Continue the investigation? Or go back? ,2,02:35:35,,
184010,1483,TRAVIS,"No, continue. I mean, if you're up for it. ",2,02:35:39,,

184014,1487,LIAM,What are you talking about? None of us did anything. None of us! We protected the people of this town! ,2,02:35:57,,
184015,1488,LAURA,It's true. ,2,02:36:02,,
184016,1489,LIAM,It is true. ,2,02:36:03,,

184018,1491,LIAM,"That's easy. Let's go solve a mystery, Nott. ",2,02:36:05,,
184019,1492,SAM,All right. ,2,02:36:09,,
184020,1493,TALIESIN,"Were you being sarcastic-- oh, no you weren't, okay. Catching up on that. ",2,02:36:10,,
184021,1494,MARISHA,"So, kids don't know anything about this, old people don't know anything about this-- ",2,02:36:15,,
184022,1495,TRAVIS,Tavern-keeper doesn't know anything about this. ,2,02:36:21,,

184024,1497,MARISHA,"But pure of heart! Still going back to the guards thing! Back to the tavern, let's go. ",2,02:36:29,,
184025,1498,SAM,Were we just on the docks? ,2,02:36:36,,
184026,1499,MATT,"Yeah, you guys were at the docks. ",2,02:36:40,,
184027,1500,LIAM,We came up with bupkus. ,2,02:36:42,,
184028,1501,LAURA,"We didn't ask anybody, we went straight to the house. ",2,02:36:43,,
184029,1502,SAM,"Okay, we'll walk around the docks and look for-- ",2,02:36:46,,
184030,1503,TRAVIS,We'll see you back at the inn. ,2,02:36:48,,
184031,1504,SAM,All right. ,2,02:36:50,,
184032,1505,LAURA,"Should we run back, or should we saunter back? ",2,02:36:52,,
184033,1506,TALIESIN,"You're going to probably, you know, poof. ",2,02:36:56,,
184034,1507,MARISHA,"Yeah, how much time does she have? ",2,02:37:00,,
184035,1508,LIAM,About a minute? ,2,02:37:02,,
184036,1509,MATT,"Yeah, it's about to fade. ",2,02:37:03,,
184037,1510,LAURA,"Yeah, I figured it had already happened probably midway talking to the kid. ",2,02:37:05,,
184038,1511,MATT,Probably. ,2,02:37:08,,
184039,1512,MARISHA,Maybe super stealthily back? ,2,02:37:10,,
184040,1513,LAURA,All right. I put my hood up. ,2,02:37:14,,
184041,1514,TALIESIN,I can maybe put a rope through the window. ,2,02:37:17,,
184042,1515,MARISHA,"Yeah, that's a good idea. ",2,02:37:20,,
184043,1516,LAURA,Is it a two-story? ,2,02:37:23,,
184044,1517,MATT,It's a two-story. You guys are up in the second story. ,2,02:37:26,,
184045,1518,TALIESIN,I got rope. ,2,02:37:28,,
184046,1519,LAURA,"Let's do that, yeah. We'll sneak around the back of the inn, and try to climb up the upstairs window. ",2,02:37:30,,
184047,1520,TRAVIS,I can keep them busy at the front door. ,2,02:37:34,,
184048,1521,TALIESIN,I'll go through the front like a proper person. ,2,02:37:36,,
184049,1522,MATT,"All right, so you guys are setting up a rope to climb up the back? You go in, on your own, up to the top, you put a rope through-- ",2,02:37:38,,
184050,1523,MARISHA,Fjord's distracting. ,2,02:37:48,,
184051,1524,LAURA,In the front. Then we're going to try to sneak-- ,2,02:37:50,,
184052,1525,TALIESIN,"Right, and then I'm going to drop some of the rope out the back window for them. ",2,02:37:52,,
184053,1526,MATT,"Easy enough to do, so those of you who want to wait and can take the rope up, you wait for a moment where nobody's watching and climb your way up into the inn safely and get to your rooms. You two, what are you doing? ",2,02:37:56,,
184054,1527,TALIESIN,"50 feet of hemp rope, it's a standard! ",2,02:38:09,,(singing)
184055,1528,LIAM,"Hey kiddo, do you want a piggy-back? ",2,02:38:11,,
184056,1529,SAM,"Sure, that sounds like a good idea. ",2,02:38:13,,
184057,1530,LIAM,"Scramble up, let's go talk to some people. ",2,02:38:15,,
184058,1531,SAM,"All right, I'll jump on Caleb's back. ",2,02:38:17,,
184059,1532,MATT,All right. ,2,02:38:19,,
184060,1533,LIAM,I'll wander down to where people are working. Where people are moving crates around. ,2,02:38:22,,
184061,1534,MARISHA,He's on Caleb's back! ,2,02:38:26,,
184062,1535,MATT,"Okay, that would be probably closer to the Northward. ",2,02:38:28,,
184063,1536,LIAM,"Okay, so that's the plan, is to look for people moving crap around, the same way that Enon is said to have. So that's what we'll do. ",2,02:38:32,,
184064,1537,MATT,"Okay, make an investigation check. ",2,02:38:41,,
184065,1538,LIAM,All right. ,2,02:38:42,,
184066,1539,SAM,"Shall I help, or no? ",2,02:38:43,,
184067,1540,MATT,If you want to. ,2,02:38:44,,
184068,1541,LIAM,Not that great. ,2,02:38:47,,
184069,1542,MATT,You aiding him would give him an advantage in the roll. ,2,02:38:48,,
184070,1543,LIAM,Oh! That didn't help. 12 for me. ,2,02:38:53,,
184071,1544,MATT,"You take a couple hours wandering through the Northward, asking questions, and most of the information you get is, they have no idea who that is, or like, ""Ah, he died? It's about time."" ",2,02:38:58,,
184072,1545,LIAM,"And there's no point even asking questions because we've asked them all for two hours, yeah? ",2,02:39:13,,
184073,1546,MATT,"I'd say yeah, based on that roll. ",2,02:39:19,,
184074,1547,LIAM,"Okay, well that's a big zero. You want to go book shopping with me? ",2,02:39:22,,
184075,1548,SAM,Sure! ,2,02:39:28,,
184076,1549,LIAM,"Okay. I believe that gentleman said that the Burnished Bibliots was in the Northward, correct? ",2,02:39:29,,
184077,1550,MATT,"I believe you are correct. Yeah, it's in the southern portion of the Northward by where it borders the Lochward. ",2,02:39:37,,
184078,1551,LIAM,"Okay, so I'll start asking questions to get us there. ",2,02:39:44,,
184079,1552,MATT,"Easily enough. You eventually are led to it, and you come to a closet that's affixed to another building. The wood used are almost driftwood and heavily weathered, and the front door is closed as you approach. It looks like a glorified storage shed that has been bolted and put up against another structure. ",2,02:39:47,,
184080,1553,LIAM,"All right, well I will walk up to the door and knock on it. ",2,02:40:15,,
184081,1554,MATT,Okay.  No response. ,2,02:40:18,,(knocks)
184082,1555,LIAM,Is there any breaks in the door or the building or cracks that Frumpkin could fit into? ,2,02:40:22,,
184083,1556,MATT,Probably not enough for a cat to slip through. ,2,02:40:32,,
184084,1557,LIAM,"Are there any windows or anything or is it all a big, dirty, dingy mess? ",2,02:40:38,,
184085,1558,MATT,"There are windows, but if you look at the back of the windows all you see is scraps of material, stacks of books, piles of boxes and crates, it's literally blocked out with things stacked up against it from the interior. ",2,02:40:42,,
184086,1559,LIAM,How busy is the front of this place? ,2,02:40:56,,
184087,1560,MATT,"Not busy at all, it's just the two of you, right now, standing at the front door. ",2,02:40:59,,
184088,1561,LIAM,"No one's around us, though? ",2,02:41:02,,
184089,1562,MATT,"It's not on the main street, it's a little pushed back, recessed about ten or 15 feet from the main road so there's no one immediately around you. But there are people walking back and forth on the road behind but you're out in the open, per se. ",2,02:41:05,,
184090,1563,SAM,And no one's coming to the door? ,2,02:41:19,,
184091,1564,MATT,"No one's come to the door yet, no. ",2,02:41:21,,
184092,1565,SAM,Want me to break in? ,2,02:41:22,,
184093,1566,LIAM, ,2,02:41:25,,
184094,1567,MATT,"Okay. A moment passes and you hear, ""Hold on!"" The door opens. It was open. There's the sound of heavy sacks go tumbling down to the interior of it and you glance around and you hear a voice go, ""Can I help you?"" ",2,02:41:30,,
184095,1568,LIAM,Hello? ,2,02:41:53,,
184096,1569,MATT,"You look down, and there's this crotchety-looking scrawny old gnome who's sitting there in the doorway. He's got this vibrant puff, like a cotton ball, of hair around his head. But it's this perfect ""U"" of bald on top. No glasses, eyes are very small and beady, and he has this bulbous, round nose at the front with this little bit of a tuft of chin white hair that matches the cotton ball tuft on the sides. He's sitting there clutching the top of the knob on the inside which is actually affixed shorter on the door and he goes, ""Well come in."" ",2,02:41:54,,
184097,1570,LIAM,"Yes please, you're open for business I take it. ",2,02:42:28,,
184098,1571,MATT,"""Always open, come on in."" ",2,02:42:31,,
184099,1572,LIAM,All right. ,2,02:42:33,,
184100,1573,MATT,"Turns around and musters his way inside. As soon as you step in the door and look around, this place looks like an episode of Hoarders. It is just floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, stacks of anything and everything: knick-knacks, small stuffed animals, toys, books, glasses, and goblets. It is the biggest, crammed flea-market into a small shed-like space you've seen. ",2,02:42:34,,
184101,1574,SAM,,2,02:43:03,,(laughing) 
184102,1575,LIAM,Frumpkin climbs back up onto Nott's shoulder and nestles in. ,2,02:43:11,,

184112,1585,LIAM,"I don't know what you just said, but I am interested in books. Particularly in the arcane realm, but any kind of book. Do you have anything that you just outright know is out of the ordinary? ",2,02:43:55,,
184113,1586,MATT,"""I'm sure we've got a few. Look around! See what you find. It's half the fun, half the journey."" ",2,02:44:11,,
184114,1587,LIAM,"All right, friend, let's-- It's like Winter's Crest morning for me and I'm scanning the shelves. ",2,02:44:18,,
184115,1588,MATT,Make an investigation check. ,2,02:44:30,,
184116,1589,SAM,"Can you give me something to look for? To distract me and give me a mission to go on, please? ",2,02:44:32,,
184117,1590,LIAM,Yes. You want to find some sort of tool that helps you do what you do best. ,2,02:44:39,,
184118,1591,SAM,All right. ,2,02:44:48,,
184119,1592,LIAM,"Investigation check, that is a 21. ",2,02:44:52,,
184120,1593,MATT,21? ,2,02:44:56,,
184121,1594,SAM,I rolled a 21 investigation check. ,2,02:44:57,,
184122,1595,MATT,All right. ,2,02:45:04,,

184124,1597,MATT,"The smell in there is dusty and moldy and you do find there is some subtle water damage and some mildew growing in one far corner and you're like ugh, put that back. However, you rolled really high. Two things catch your eye. One, there appears to be the remnants of some sort of notebook, a sketchbook that is written in a language you do not understand-- What languages do you know? ",2,02:45:12,,
184125,1598,LIAM,"I speak Sylvan, Common, and Celestial and I also can Comprehend Languages as a ritual spell but I think that takes some time. ",2,02:45:46,,
184126,1599,MATT,It does take ten minutes. ,2,02:46:09,,
184127,1600,LIAM,Ten minutes. ,2,02:46:10,,
184128,1601,MATT,"But you glance through the book, and while you cannot read the text you do recognize that there are elements at the back of the book that have a hint of arcane nature. That's one of two books you find with that roll. ",2,02:46:12,,
184129,1602,SAM,It's like the adult section for him. ,2,02:46:28,,
184130,1603,MATT,"I know. The second book you find is written in Zemnian, which you can read. ",2,02:46:30,,
184131,1604,LIAM,That's correct. ,2,02:46:36,,
184132,1605,MATT,The title translates to Fiends of Folklore. ,2,02:46:38,,

184326,1799,LAURA,"It might be down before we come back, is the thing. ",2,03:01:06,,
184327,1800,TALIESIN,I assume he's going to-- that's fair. ,2,03:01:10,,
184328,1801,TRAVIS,Where were you when you saw these cloaked figures? ,2,03:01:13,,
184329,1802,SAM,I had gone out to do some window shopping. ,2,03:01:19,,
184330,1803,TRAVIS,At 2:00AM? ,2,03:01:23,,
184331,1804,SAM,"Yes, I wasn't very successful. I had walked by the general store-- ",2,03:01:25,,
184332,1805,LAURA,"Oh, we went there. ",2,03:01:31,,
184333,1806,MARISHA,"Yeah, we did. ",2,03:01:33,,
184334,1807,SAM,"I passed by a place called Natural Remedies, herbs and medicinal things. I went by a spot named Jackalwere, it's a smithy. ",2,03:01:34,,
184335,1808,LAURA,"Okay, but where did you see the cloaked guys? ",2,03:01:45,,
184336,1809,SAM,It was between-- I don't remember. ,2,03:01:47,,
184337,1810,MATT,It was one block north of the Natural Remedies. ,2,03:01:50,,
184338,1811,MARISHA,Natural Remedies. What was the other one? Jackalwere? ,2,03:01:54,,
184339,1812,SAM,I think that was what it was called. ,2,03:01:58,,
184340,1813,MATT,"Yeah, Jackalwere Smiths. ",2,03:02:00,,
184341,1814,SAM,We could do a little stakeout! ,2,03:02:06,,
184342,1815,TRAVIS,We could. ,2,03:02:08,,
184343,1816,MARISHA,That's true. How do people send messages in this town? Have we figured that out? ,2,03:02:10,,
184344,1817,SAM,"Probably by foot or by horse, right? ",2,03:02:17,,
184345,1818,TALIESIN,Not that big of a town. ,2,03:02:22,,
184346,1819,TRAVIS,"Should someone stay up? Well, I was thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof of the inn in case someone comes for us while everyone else is out. ",2,03:02:23,,
184347,1820,LAURA,How would we let anybody know? ,2,03:02:29,,
184348,1821,TRAVIS,I don't know. Can you conjure those golden orbs up into the air as like a signal? ,2,03:02:32,,
184349,1822,LIAM,It's pretty limited. They don't go that far. ,2,03:02:39,,
184350,1823,TRAVIS,Maybe we just risk it. ,2,03:02:43,,
184351,1824,SAM,Yeah! ,2,03:02:46,,
184352,1825,LAURA,Let's risk it. ,2,03:02:47,,
184353,1826,TRAVIS,"It's 2:00AM, I'm sure everybody will be asleep. Let's risk it. ",2,03:02:49,,
184354,1827,MARISHA,Before we leave-- is there a window in the hall? Or are there only windows in our bedrooms? ,2,03:02:57,,
184355,1828,MATT,"There is no window in the hall, only in the rooms. ",2,03:03:12,,
184356,1829,MARISHA,"Okay, that's fine. On our side of the room-- ",2,03:03:15,,
184357,1830,MATT,You have three rooms between you. ,2,03:03:19,,
184358,1831,TALIESIN,There's three rooms and they all have windows. ,2,03:03:23,,
184359,1832,MATT,Correct. ,2,03:03:24,,
184360,1833,MARISHA,"On our side of the door, I'm going to take out my healer's kit. Do I have any bandages or medical tape or anything like that? ",2,03:03:26,,
184361,1834,MATT,"Not medical tape, but there are clean strips of cloth and some adhesive bandages, basic general-- ",2,03:03:43,,
184362,1835,LAURA,No tape?! ,2,03:03:51,,
184363,1836,MARISHA,I'm going to tie a bandage ever so lightly around one side of the handle onto something on to the other side of the door. If there's something like a lamp or some kind of pipe or something I can tie it to. ,2,03:03:54,,
184364,1837,LAURA,So that we'll know if someone tried to come in the room? ,2,03:04:12,,
184365,1838,MARISHA,Correct. ,2,03:04:14,,
184366,1839,LAURA,Okay. ,2,03:04:15,,
184367,1840,MATT,You can pull one bandage out and affix to one of the chair legs nearby. You could do that. ,2,03:04:17,,
184368,1841,TALIESIN,Oh for god's sake. I pull out a big thing of string. ,2,03:04:24,,
184369,1842,MARISHA,"Okay, yeah. I'll take some string and just some twine and-- ",2,03:04:29,,
184370,1843,LAURA,What are we going to do? Leave through our window? ,2,03:04:34,,
184371,1844,MARISHA,Yeah. ,2,03:04:37,,
184372,1845,LAURA,To their window? ,2,03:04:39,,
184373,1846,MARISHA,"Well, I figured we're all in the same room at this point. ",2,03:04:41,,
184374,1847,LIAM,What are you trying to do? ,2,03:04:44,,
184375,1848,MARISHA,I'm trying to make sure that if someone tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in. ,2,03:04:47,,
184376,1849,LIAM,I can take care of that. ,2,03:04:52,,
184377,1850,TALIESIN,"Oh, well then, I'm taking my string back. ",2,03:04:53,,
184378,1851,MARISHA,What can you do? ,2,03:04:55,,
184379,1852,LIAM,I have some magic for that. ,2,03:04:57,,
184380,1853,SAM,"Yeah, he has a magical spell that alerts you when someone tries to break in your room. ",2,03:05:02,,
184381,1854,LIAM,That is correct. Yeah. I will take a moment to do that and it will let me know. ,2,03:05:08,,
184382,1855,SAM,"Best part is, it doesn't alert him when I sneak in or out. ",2,03:05:15,,
184383,1856,LIAM,That you know of. ,2,03:05:19,,
184384,1857,SAM,Wait. What? ,2,03:05:21,,
184385,1858,LIAM,One mile of the warded area. ,2,03:05:28,,
184386,1859,SAM,Ooh! ,2,03:05:30,,
184387,1860,MARISHA,That's better! Let's do that. ,2,03:05:31,,
184388,1861,LIAM,I just need ten minutes. And I pull out a little spool of silvered thread and stretch it out. Where did you want this? Over the window? ,2,03:05:33,,
184389,1862,MARISHA,"Well, I was going to say in the door, but if there's maybe a place in the hall. ",2,03:05:42,,
184390,1863,LIAM,"Well, I can do the entire room really, I can go doorknob to-- The funny thing about this thread, there's no end to it. So I start looping it all the way around the room and tie it off, and take out one of my books from the holster, the one on the left side, and I open it up. You guys watch as I spend ten minutes referring to the book and tracing symbols on the floor. Along, underneath the thread, and about ten minutes of time, nothing happens, but that's taken care of. ",2,03:05:48,,
184391,1864,LAURA,Nice. ,2,03:06:20,,
184392,1865,SAM,"See, he's really good. ",2,03:06:22,,
184393,1866,LAURA,Yeah. ,2,03:06:23,,
184394,1867,TRAVIS,Didn't really look like much. ,2,03:06:25,,
184395,1868,LIAM,"Yeah, either that or I'm really bullshitting you and nothing happened. ",2,03:06:27,,
184396,1869,LAURA,"Either way, I liked it. Let's sneak out. ",2,03:06:30,,
184397,1870,TALIESIN,"I'm going to do one last thing before we leave, which is just tussle the room a bit so it looks like it's been robbed. Just in case they do come in. ",2,03:06:35,,
184398,1871,MATT,"Okay, so you toss the room a bit, muddle up the space, and you guys, one by one, climb out the back of the window, down the rope, and into the alley behind the inn. Looking about, you're waiting until about post-midnight, you said? ",2,03:06:41,,
184399,1872,TRAVIS,Yeah. ,2,03:06:55,,
184400,1873,MATT,"Okay, so it's dark. The various lanterns that dangle on the hook poles at different intersections of the street are lit. Other than that, you have a faint bit of moonlight that's coming through the sky. There are some clouds, but they're a bit broken up, so every now and then the moon cover can vanish and then return, but for now you have moonlight in the city. Where are you guys going? ",2,03:06:56,,
184401,1874,LAURA,Towards the north end. ,2,03:07:18,,
184402,1875,TRAVIS,"I ought to be leading the way, I reckon. ",2,03:07:20,,
184403,1876,SAM,"Yeah, I'll go to where I saw the three cloaked figures. ",2,03:07:22,,
184404,1877,MATT,"A little ways north of Natural Remedies? Okay. I would like everybody to make a stealth check, please. ",2,03:07:27,,
184405,1878,SAM,"Stealth check. Do I still have the blessing? No, I don't. ",2,03:07:32,,
184406,1879,LAURA,"No, you don't. But I can do it to everybody, one by one, if we get to an open area. ",2,03:07:34,,

184415,1888,SAM,"Should we fan out a bit? Cover a couple corners, so we can still see each other? ",2,03:08:30,,
184416,1889,TRAVIS,Good idea. ,2,03:08:34,,
184417,1890,LAURA,Yeah. I'm going to go with Fjord. ,2,03:08:35,,

184518,1991,MATT,You do as well? ,2,03:14:50,,

184521,1994,TALIESIN,I'm in my black hood. I've got my hood up now. ,2,03:15:03,,
184522,1995,SAM,Anywhere to hide? ,2,03:15:06,,
184523,1996,MATT,"There are some small alcoves, but you guys are out in the open, now. They've seen you. ",2,03:15:08,,

184526,1999,LAURA,I walk into the lake and crouch down? ,2,03:15:23,,
184527,2000,MATT,Jester walks up and wades in about six inches of water and just-- gives her best duck impression. ,2,03:15:27,,
184528,2001,SAM,I will take off my mask and start attacking Caleb in a convincing fashion. Not to draw blood but-- yeah. ,2,03:15:35,,
184529,2002,MATT,Make a deception check. ,2,03:15:48,,
184530,2003,SAM,Deception check? ,2,03:15:49,,
184531,2004,MATT,Yes. ,2,03:15:50,,
184532,2005,SAM,Oh. ,2,03:15:51,,
184533,2006,LIAM,"Can I start going  Oh get off, you little beast! To help with the illusion? ",2,03:15:53,,(groans)
184534,2007,SAM,,2,03:15:59,,(snarling noises) 
184535,2008,MATT,"Sure, make a deception check. ",2,03:16:01,,
184536,2009,SAM,"Oh, my deception check was a three minus three. ",2,03:16:03,,
184537,2010,LIAM,But roll with advantage. ,2,03:16:05,,

184541,2014,LIAM,Oh no! ,2,03:16:11,,
184542,2015,MATT,"Okay so as soon as these two crownsguard see this, they go ""Shit!"" They pull their blades and they start charging you, Nott, to try and protect their other crownsguard-- ",2,03:16:13,,
184543,2016,LIAM,I take Nott and slam her into a wall as hard as I can and say: Down you beast! ,2,03:16:25,,
184544,2017,MATT,"All right, as you rush up in a jog, blades drawn, one of them is going to go ahead and attempt to strike. ",2,03:16:31,,
184545,2018,SAM,Oh god! Sure. ,2,03:16:38,,
184546,2019,MATT,That is going to be a 14 to hit. ,2,03:16:43,,
184547,2020,SAM,Miss! ,2,03:16:45,,
184548,2021,MATT,"So you manage to  and narrowly dodge the blade as it strikes through the back of your cloak and pins it to the side of a wooden pole that is on the outside of an overhang where some of the fish are being left out to dry and turn into fish jerky. It holds you in place as you're snarling and looking scared. The other one pulls out his blade and says ""Where did this thing come from!?"" ",2,03:16:46,,(squeaks)
184549,2022,LIAM,I have it! And I punch Nott right in the face. ,2,03:17:08,,

184557,2030,LIAM,"This one is mine, thank you. Beat her within an inch of her life. ",2,03:17:36,,
184558,2031,MATT,I need you to make a deception check on that one. ,2,03:17:42,,
184559,2032,TALIESIN,We are just the worst. This is just terrible. ,2,03:17:45,,
184560,2033,MARISHA,Oh man. ,2,03:17:49,,
184561,2034,LIAM,,2,03:17:50,,(cheering) 
184562,2035,SAM,We've practiced this before. We got this routine down. ,2,03:17:54,,
184563,2036,MATT,"You see a look of disappointment come across the two crownsguards' faces in their inability to help you skewer this small, feral creature. They both put their blades away. ""All right if you see anything else, give a shout. "" ",2,03:17:59,,(spits)
184564,2037,SAM,Ugh. ,2,03:18:16,,
184565,2038,MATT,They both continue their walk past the rest of you. ,2,03:18:17,,
184566,2039,LIAM,The rest of you lot fall in line. I drag the little one off. ,2,03:18:19,,
184567,2040,SAM,,2,03:18:24,,(snivels) 
184568,2041,MATT,They look over at the tiefling-- partially crouched in the water. ,2,03:18:27,,
184569,2042,SAM,She's taking a shit. ,2,03:18:33,,
184570,2043,LAURA,I really had to pee! ,2,03:18:35,,
184571,2044,MATT,"""Hey! Not in the Ustaloch!"" ",2,03:18:37,,(laughter) 
184572,2045,LAURA,Okay. Oh okay. I get out. I stand up and slowly dredge out of the water. ,2,03:18:45,,
184573,2046,MATT,"Your legs are soaked from thigh to foot, and they both eye you warily and slowly walk past. ",2,03:18:59,,

184575,2048,MARISHA,It's real cold out. ,2,03:19:10,,
184576,2049,LIAM,Have they cleared the way? ,2,03:19:12,,
184577,2050,MATT,"Eventually, they pass beyond a point where you feel absolute dread of their presence. ",2,03:19:15,,
184578,2051,TRAVIS,Is that a natural thing for you guys to just attack each other in moments of stress? ,2,03:19:21,,
184579,2052,LIAM,"Are you all right? I am so very sorry, I'm so sorry-- ",2,03:19:25,,
184580,2053,SAM,"No, I'm fine that was good acting. You were perfect. I panicked, I didn't know what to do. I was trying to create some sort of distraction. ",2,03:19:27,,
184581,2054,LIAM,Let me see your teeth. Okay. You look all right. ,2,03:19:34,,
184582,2055,SAM,,2,03:19:38,,(laughter) 
184583,2056,TRAVIS,"Oh, I can't tell if that got worse or better. ",2,03:19:45,,
184584,2057,MARISHA,You fixed them a bit! ,2,03:19:48,,
184585,2058,LIAM,Okay. Who wants to go to the circus? ,2,03:19:52,,
184586,2059,MARISHA,Yay. ,2,03:19:56,,
184587,2060,MATT,"All right, you guys are make the rest of the path to the outskirts of the circus. You see at the very front flap of it you see a crownsguard who's like  sitting there, his arms crossed to the front keeping an eye out, he is doing late-shift. You do see the faint distant flickering glow of firelight from the back side of the circus. ",2,03:19:58,,(yawn)
184588,2061,MARISHA,What is that? Do you guys have like a nightlight? ,2,03:20:19,,
184589,2062,TALIESIN,It's where we camp. ,2,03:20:23,,
184590,2063,MATT,"Yeah, you saw it earlier, you saw the campfire. ",2,03:20:25,,
184591,2064,MARISHA,Oh sure. ,2,03:20:26,,
184592,2065,TRAVIS,"If you want to make your ways around, I could distract them for a moment, have a conversation with them. ",2,03:20:28,,
184593,2066,MARISHA,Do they still look like crownsguard? ,2,03:20:33,,
184594,2067,MATT,Yes. ,2,03:20:34,,
184595,2068,TRAVIS,For an hour. ,2,03:20:35,,
184596,2069,MARISHA,"Okay, yeah. ",2,03:20:37,,
184597,2070,LIAM,You you want to go with them? I'll go with him. ,2,03:20:38,,
184598,2071,SAM,"Sure, but will you be watching me or no? You don't have to. ",2,03:20:42,,
184599,2072,LIAM,Frumpkin will go with you. ,2,03:20:48,,
184600,2073,SAM,All right. I'll go with you and-- who else is going? Are you stealthy? ,2,03:20:49,,
184601,2074,LAURA,We'll take care of you. Don't worry! ,2,03:20:56,,
184602,2075,TALIESIN,They're not going to talk to you without ,2,03:20:59,,
184603,2076,LIAM,"I'm a little jittery, do you want to be a front man for a little while? ",2,03:21:02,,
184604,2077,TRAVIS,"Sure I got it, yeah. ",2,03:21:04,,
184605,2078,LIAM,Okay. ,2,03:21:05,,
184606,2079,MATT,"All right, so what are the groups here? ",2,03:21:06,,
184607,2080,SAM,The girls and the boys. ,2,03:21:09,,
184608,2081,TRAVIS,Caleb and me-- ,2,03:21:10,,
184609,2082,LAURA,And Molly. ,2,03:21:11,,
184610,2083,SAM,,2,03:21:13,,(laughter) 
184611,2084,TALIESIN,I'm fabulous. ,2,03:21:15,,
184612,2085,MATT,"Molly, who are you going with? ",2,03:21:17,,
184613,2086,TALIESIN,"I'm going with the girls, because the circus kids won't talk to them without me. ",2,03:21:19,,
184614,2087,MATT,"All right, so the three of you are going forward. What are you doing? I guess I should ask. ",2,03:21:22,,
184615,2088,TRAVIS,"I walk up to the guard.  It's a late night, not much action this evening. See anything unusual? ",2,03:21:27,,(regal voice)
184616,2089,MATT,"I need to sleep. Regular hours."" ",2,03:21:35,,
184617,2090,TRAVIS,"Yeah, have you heard heard? How long are they supposed to be here? ",2,03:21:44,,
184618,2091,MATT,"""Until they finish this fucking investigation. They keep bugging people for information, but they're all just clammed up and not saying shit."" ",2,03:21:46,,
184619,2092,TRAVIS,"At least you're by the tent, they've had us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire time. ",2,03:21:54,,
184620,2093,MATT,"""It's bullshit. I wish they would just go ahead and execute them. That carnival master or whatever and get it over with."" ",2,03:21:57,,
184621,2094,TRAVIS,"Did they find anything inside, today? Tell me, ",2,03:22:05,,
184622,2095,MATT,"""They investigated the corpses and found nothing yet. Still in there if you want to take a look at it."" ",2,03:22:09,,
184623,2096,TRAVIS,Would you mind if we popped in? ,2,03:22:14,,
184624,2097,MATT,"""I mean I suppose so."" Make a deception check. ",2,03:22:17,,
184625,2098,MARISHA,"Something good, something good? ",2,03:22:22,,
184626,2099,TALIESIN,No. ,2,03:22:26,,
184627,2100,TRAVIS,Oh! 13. ,2,03:22:27,,
184628,2101,MATT,"Okay. He thinks a second on it. ""Oh I suppose so. Go on in."" ",2,03:22:32,,
184629,2102,TRAVIS,"We'll be quick, super fast. ",2,03:22:41,,
184630,2103,MATT,"""If there's any way to expedite this, if you can pin it on any of them, we can just kill them and take care of it. Let me know."" ",2,03:22:43,,
184631,2104,TRAVIS,,2,03:22:56,,(as Grog) That worked way better than I thought. Like we should-- I mean-- (as Fjord) should we look around for stuff or what? (laughter) 
184632,2105,SAM,Yes. Yes. ,2,03:23:10,,
184633,2106,LIAM,You are very good with voices. ,2,03:23:12,,
184634,2107,TRAVIS,"Well you know, I do a little mimicry here and there. We should look, come on. Check the grounds. Maybe we can find where the bodies are laying. ",2,03:23:16,,
184635,2108,LIAM,"Yeah, let's have a look around. ",2,03:23:22,,
184636,2109,MATT,There's no light inside. ,2,03:23:24,,
184637,2110,LIAM,I take a rag out of my side satchel and I cast-- what the hell is it called because I've only been a wizard for a short time-- one Dancing Light underneath the rags so it's only dim. ,2,03:23:31,,
184638,2111,MATT,"All right, so you have this self-made hooded lantern with the hood you have over it. ",2,03:23:46,,
184639,2112,LIAM,Yeah. ,2,03:23:52,,
184640,2113,MATT,Okay. ,2,03:23:53,,
184641,2114,MARISHA,That's dope. ,2,03:23:54,,
184642,2115,LIAM,What the fuck are we looking for in here? ,2,03:23:56,,
184643,2116,MATT,"And Nott, you're going with them? ",2,03:23:59,,
184644,2117,SAM,I'm with the girls. ,2,03:24:00,,
184645,2118,TRAVIS,"Where did the bodies fall? Over there, didn't they? ",2,03:24:02,,
184646,2119,LIAM,"That's right, yeah. ",2,03:24:03,,
184647,2120,TRAVIS,Well let's search the grounds. ,2,03:24:05,,
184648,2121,MATT,"You make your way inside, the smell is pretty bad. You can smell the flesh beginning to decay. ",2,03:24:07,,
184649,2122,TRAVIS,Have they moved the bodies or are the bodies still there? ,2,03:24:11,,
184650,2123,MATT,"With a bit of looking, the bodies are still there where they left them. They have not moved, you can see a couple of remnants of notes and sheets that have been crumpled, but the bodies have been left where they are. ",2,03:24:13,,
184651,2124,TRAVIS,Can we check the bodies for anything? ,2,03:24:27,,
184652,2125,LIAM,"Is there anything arcane? From all my studies, does anything here ring any bell? I have a photographic memory. ",2,03:24:34,,
184653,2126,MATT,Go and make a religion check. ,2,03:24:45,,
184654,2127,LIAM,All right. That is a ten. ,2,03:24:50,,
184655,2128,MATT,"Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of research on the undead, or whatever might be the essence of this creature's creation, and the more you look at it, you're like, ""This is not my specialty."" ",2,03:24:54,,
184656,2129,LIAM,"Okay. What about the perimeters of here, where all the people were? There was a swarm of people. I spend five minutes seeing anything was dropped of interest. ",2,03:25:05,,
184657,2130,MATT,"Make an investigation check, both of you. ",2,03:25:13,,
184658,2131,TRAVIS,That's better. ,2,03:25:16,,
184659,2132,LIAM,I miss the twins. ,2,03:25:18,,
184660,2133,TRAVIS,16. ,2,03:25:20,,
184661,2134,LIAM,Big ten. ,2,03:25:21,,
184662,2135,MATT,"Glancing about, you can see the track marks of everyone fleeing. You can see the spatters of blood. You can see the place where the transformation occurred. There is a horrible shedding of certain layers of flesh. You can see previously existing layers of flesh and muscle that were shed as whatever this undead thing was fell to the ground. Once again, you make a religion check as well. ",2,03:25:23,,
184663,2136,TRAVIS,Okay. Roll high. I did not. Ten. ,2,03:25:58,,
184664,2137,MATT,Yeah. This is not your specialty. You have little experience with the undead and this type of magic. ,2,03:26:01,,
184665,2138,TRAVIS,We can't spend that long in here. Maybe we just take a bit of it with us. Do you have a pocket? ,2,03:26:08,,
184666,2139,LIAM,"I have many pockets, of course I have pockets. ",2,03:26:13,,
184667,2140,TRAVIS,Like a jar? I-I got no pockets! ,2,03:26:16,,
184668,2141,SAM,You designed a character with no pockets?! Why would you do that? ,2,03:26:19,,
184669,2142,TRAVIS,"There's no pockets! All right, but I'll check. ",2,03:26:24,,
184670,2143,LIAM,He's just in the Blue Man Group unitard and that's it. ,2,03:26:27,,
184671,2144,MARISHA,I'm sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed and he doesn't know why. ,2,03:26:30,,
184672,2145,LIAM,So this dead thing is here in front of me? ,2,03:26:34,,
184673,2146,MATT,"Two of them. There's the main one, the ground zero one, which is where you were putting all your attention, and then there's the woman, who was transformed as part of the first. ",2,03:26:41,,
184674,2147,LIAM,"I will take my dagger, and I will slice a little bit off of the woman, and it's going to get dark in here and I will snuff out the light and use the rag to roll it up and I'll put the little piece in my pack. ",2,03:26:47,,
184675,2148,MATT,With a squishy sound you place it within your pack. ,2,03:27:03,,
184676,2149,LIAM,"Let's get out of here, I'm going to be sick. ",2,03:27:10,,
184677,2150,TRAVIS,Agreed. ,2,03:27:12,,
184678,2151,MATT,"All right. The four of you, I need you to roll stealth checks, please. ",2,03:27:13,,
184679,2152,MARISHA,Oh not bad! 21. ,2,03:27:20,,
184680,2153,TALIESIN,17. ,2,03:27:26,,
184681,2154,LAURA,18. ,2,03:27:27,,
184682,2155,SAM,25. ,2,03:27:28,,
184683,2156,MATT,"Without issue, you guys quickly dart around the side of the tent and make your way right towards the central area where the multitude of tents to this back encampment is placed. There is a single campfire. The embers are burning out. It has not been kept up. You do see two crownsguard who are currently keeping watch. One of them is slumped in a chair across from the fire and is nodding off. The other is doing a basic patrol and looking around. Other than that, you don't hear any sounds, you don't see anybody else. Just the two crownsguard. ",2,03:27:29,,
184684,2157,TALIESIN,Which of the tents is currently occupied? ,2,03:28:06,,
184685,2158,MATT,Then there's a medium sized tent on the north side. Who would be in that one? ,2,03:28:10,,
184686,2159,TALIESIN,"Toya and Kylre share a tent, that's right. It would be Desmond. ",2,03:28:49,,
184687,2160,MATT,"Desmond would be the other one. It would be Gustav staying there as well, but Gustav changes between the tent and the cart. ",2,03:28:55,,
184688,2161,MARISHA,The cart? ,2,03:29:02,,
184689,2162,TALIESIN,We have a wagon. ,2,03:29:04,,
184690,2163,LAURA,"Molly, I have a question. What made you guys set up your tent here? ",2,03:29:05,,
184691,2164,TALIESIN,"We were told to set it up here, if I recall. ",2,03:29:10,,
184692,2165,LAURA,In this specific area? ,2,03:29:13,,
184693,2166,TALIESIN,"That sounds right. If I recall, we were specifically told to set up tent right here. ",2,03:29:18,,
184694,2167,MARISHA,"And it's by the lake, right? ",2,03:29:21,,
184695,2168,MATT,Maybe 150-200 feet away from it. ,2,03:29:24,,
184696,2169,MARISHA,That's pretty close to a lake. ,2,03:29:28,,

As the cat darts under the tent and makes its way through, you glance over to the fire and sees a large dark shape step out from one of the tents and you watch as one of the guards who's sitting in the chair stands up and crumples onto the ground without a sound. You see the other guard look over, go over and run up to him and start to check on him. You guys hear a voice in the back start saying, ""Damon? Damon?"" ",2,04:05:44,,(laughs)
