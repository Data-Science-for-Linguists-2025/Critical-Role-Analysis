Opened Repo & set up .md files 
Have already downloaded and confirmed the content of CR campaign 2 (141 episodes)files
Contacted CR by email form on their site to request permission to use their data with explanation of the project
Writing up rough draft project plan with some additional ideas in more detail

#### Next goals
- CR data included .py file to convert html text files to json files, run this
- Confirm with Stuart at Kryogenix origins of transcripts
	- CRTranscript (a fan movement) did most of C2 but according to CR [here](https://critrole.com/cr-transcript-closed-captions-update/) this changed around episode 54
- start building df for CR data to explore what is included (time stamps?)
- explore possibility of comparing with other similar data
	- Could not find transcripts for 4sd (the post-episode weekly recap/chat show)
	- Considering comparing with similar D&D liveplay podcasts with different casts & DMs 
		- CR data includes EXU DMd by Aabria (8 episodes) and Calamity DMd by Brennan (4 episodes) but there's a huge discrepancy in data volume
		- Dimension20 (another liveplay podcast) has fanmade transcripts [here](https://dimension20.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_Transcripts)
			- There are a couple D20 stories also DMd by Aabria if we wanted to look at those as a woman DM compared to CR
	- If these aren't ideal I can look elsewhere for other data but are my initial thoughts
