We've got Lou Wilson.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Hi, my name's Lou Wilson. I'll be playing Whitney Jammer. Is that": null, "good? [laughing] Should I say more?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yeah, no that's okay.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Should I say more?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0No, it's great.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It was great.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Right at the camera.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0That seems right to me.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That was good. Erika Ishii.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Hi, I'm Erika Ishii, and I'm playing xX_BrokenDream_Xx.": null, "[laughing] AKA, Dream.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Danielle.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Hi, I'm Danielle Radford and I'm playing Sam Black. [laughing]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And newcomer to the AP community, Brennan Lee Mulligan.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Hi, I'm Brennan Lee Mulligan, and I'll be playing Evan Kelmp.": null, "[cast snickering]": null, "Erika:\u00a0It begins.": null, "Lou:\u00a0It begins.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh! This is gonna be great. All right. A couple things you need": null, "to know before we get started. It's not \"Dungeons & Dragons\". We are": null, "using the \"Kids on Brooms\" system. So, I'm gonna explain it to y'all": null, "really fast so you can keep along at home. \"Kids on Brooms\" has six": null, "stats. It's Fight, Flight, Brains, Brawn, Grit, and Charm. And it uses": null, "the full polyhedral array, absent the percentile dice, which just means": null, "it's all seven except for that one with the double zeros on the D10 that": null, "no one understands anyway.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Never liked him.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yep!": null, "Danielle:\u00a0I don't know her.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Are the zeros high or low?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0No one knows! What's all zeros? Is that 100, is that 0? We don't": null, "worry about that here. So, you have one die that's associated with each": null, "of your stats. Whenever you need to make a roll, I will set the": null, "difficulty for it and you will roll your die associated with that stat.": null, "If it's a magical spell, you'll be adding your Magic d4 along with it,": null, "and you're taking the sum total, you're trying to meet or beat my": null, "difficulty. These dice are very cool in that if you roll the highest": null, "number on the die that you're rolling, it's called a Lucky Break and you": null, "get to roll again, add 'em up, sum total. If you beat the difficulty by": null, "more than five, then something extra good happens. If you fail by more": null, "than five, something interesting happens. And there's a little house": null, "rule we're adding to our \"Kids on Brooms\" game, which is called the": null, "Common-Fucking-Sense Die. It's a d6, so whenever you use normal logic to": null, "deal with wizard ridiculousness, you add your d6, it becomes a die pool,": null, "and we will proceed accordingly. There's also Adversity tokens. We love": null, "to fail forward here, so any time you miss a roll, you fail a roll, you": null, "get an Adversity token that you can spend one for one to boost a future": null, "die roll, or on special abilities that you all have that we'll see over": null, "time. So, with that in mind.": null, "Lou:\u00a0That was tight, that was tight.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Thank you!": null, "Lou:\u00a0That was real tight. That was good.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Incredibly solid.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Thank you.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I feel like I honestly, that was the refresher I needed. [laughing]": null, "I honestly didn't read the core rule book before showing up today, so": null, "this was great.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Now I know what any of this means.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I will forget all of this immediately.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Perfect. We love asking questions, so feel free to ask away. And": null, "with that, we will dissolve into the story of \"Misfits and Magic\". And": null, "we begin with an owl, a big beautiful brown owl with flecked white": null, "feathers soaring across the Chicago skyline headed towards the South": null, "Side where Whitney Jammer\u2026 Where would this owl find you at like, 3:00": null, "p.m.?": null, "Lou:\u00a0Bro, you know I'm on the field. Or actually, probably in the gym.": null, "It's probably basketball practice. So, we're out here running drills. We": null, "need to place point guard for the team, so yeah, Whit is probably out": null, "here just practice passing drills, and you know, basketball shit.": null, "[laughing]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's all of 'em.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Just general basketball shit. Lots of sweat, lots of screaming,": null, "lots of, \"Two, two!\" Yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah. You're practicing your triangle offense, we love it.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Of course. You know it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You post up, down at the base\u2026 You should never be there, but": null, "it's okay. Strike that, you're doing a Mikan Drill, 'cause I do know": null, "basketball, and while you're up under the rim, you hear a little tapping": null, "[tapping] as you see an owl carrying something square in its beak up in": null, "a far, high window.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Yeah, I hold the ball, I raise my hand to stop the drill, and I go,": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Ay, yo, look at that big-ass bird up there!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The entire gym\u2026 You're on the varsity team, but JV and": null, "frosh/soph are also in there, and when you speak, the entire gym\u2026 I": null, "don't know why your coach is just like, \"I respect Jammer on this.\" We": null, "all stop, everyone looks up, and as attention turns up to the window,": null, "that owl just [trills] and dives out and away and is not perceived by": null, "the rest of the group.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Hey, y'all see that? Y'all see that big-ass\uff0d?": null, "Teammate: No, I didn't see anything.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Roger, you didn't see that big-ass bird?": null, "Roger: No. Dude, why are you looking out a window? We have a big game.": null, "What are you\uff0d": null, "Jammer:\u00a0No, yeah, of course, of course, yo, we've gotta beat Jefferson,": null, "but you didn't see? That was a big bird. We don't\u2026 Bro.": null, "Roger:\u00a0We don't\u2026 Yeah, there's not birds.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0We don't have birds around here.": null, "Roger:\u00a0Is it like a pigeon?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it was-": null, "Roger:\u00a0I saw a big pigeon with a Cheeto earlier today.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yo, that's some crazy shit, right?": null, "Roger:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Do you think that pigeons got preferences around food? Do you": null, "think there are some pigeons that are like, \"I like Cheetos,\" and then": null, "there are other pigeons who are like, \"I like Fritos,\" and then the": null, "other pigeons are like, \"I don't fuck with Doritos\"?": null, "Roger:\u00a0You know what? I've never seen a pigeon eat a Taki, so I feel": null, "like maybe.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Maybe that's a thing.": null, "Roger:\u00a0Yeah. Maybe it's a thing. They don't like spicy.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0But this was not a pigeon, bro, this was a bigger bird.": null, "Roger:\u00a0Yo, why don't we take a water break or something? 'Cause you feel": null, "really hung up on this and I need you to get your head in the game.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0The fact that nobody else saw this, I'ma go check outside.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Ay\uff0d": null, "Roger:\u00a0If you wanna run by like, just the dirt, just something, you\uff0d": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Bro, it's not like that. It's not like that.": null, "Roger:\u00a0Stay hydrated, friend.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, of course.": null, "Roger:\u00a0Cool.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna go get a Gatorade, clear my head,": null, "we'll get back here, you know, work, keep running shit. \u00a0": null, "Lou: Yeah, and I step outside to drink a Gatorade and make sure that I": null, "saw what I saw.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah. Basically the moment you step outside, the entire gym sort": null, "of re-erupts into full-focused drills, and you see, as you step out and": null, "away and out of the eye line of the door, just an owl that goes up to": null, "your knee height is standing on the ground, looks at you, gives you a": null, "little wink, and then waddles over.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, damn. Hey, I'm sorry I don't have any Cheetos or shit on me": null, "to feed you.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It fluffs up.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0You're real, right? Can I?": null, "Lou:\u00a0I reach out and touch the owl?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The owl definitely does that, tries to turn its head away, but": null, "doesn't lean out, so you're able to touch the side of its head.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I immediately\uff0d": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it just sort of freezes.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Retract my hand and I'm like, \u00a0": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, shit, you ain't supposed to touch birds, but I just wanna": null, "make sure.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It waddles a little closer and then drops the massive envelope": null, "in its mouth at your feet.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I, is this for me?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[sighs] It sighs.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, yeah, it is? Okay.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Is there anything on the letter? Does it have, like-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah. So, you're holding this really intricate vellum envelope": null, "that's sealed with a navy blue wax seal with a pair of hands with some": null, "stars in 'em, it's got glitter and shit in it, it's really cute.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think this is easily the most elaborate piece of mail Whitney has": null, "ever seen, and it's just like,": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Am I supposed to open this? This is too nice. This seems way too": null, "nice to open.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The owl just sort of gives a little.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Right, okay. I'm gonna rip it open and pull out its contents.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, you pull out an intricately-folded piece of parchment": null, "that, as you unfold it, the spacial dimensions on it are wild, and it": null, "turns to this long, two-foot-long scroll of parchment. And the moment": null, "you start to read it, you actually hear a female voice as the owl opens": null, "is mouth and speaks along with it. And if you're looking down and": null, "looking up it's kind of going back and forth. It keeps cadence with": null, "however you're reading this, and it just says,": null, "Voice:\u00a0Congratulations on your acceptance to the Gowpenny Academy of the": null, "Arcane Arts. Your magical potential, latent though it may be, has been": null, "noted, and you are invited to attend the upcoming school year slated to": null, "begin on September 1st. As you've been up to this point classified as a": null, "non-magical person, two important things must happen quickly. First, if": null, "your non-magical parents, family, or guardians have been alerted to this": null, "development, they must sign the release waiver, contained, that both": null, "consents to your attendance and the requisite memory spell that": null, "maintains the secrecy of the magical world. Failure to comply will": null, "result in intrusive and unpleasant mage intervention. Second, please use": null, "the enclosed teleportation pellet at your earliest availability. It will": null, "transport you to a magical neighborhood adjacent to the departure train": null, "to Gowpenny, and I, Headmistress Boudicca Philtrum, will personally": null, "escort you as you acquire vital school supplies for the term. If you": null, "choose to forego this once in a lifetime opportunity for a life of quiet": null, "mundanity, please burn this letter and forget it ever happened. Thank": null, "you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Boudicca? [snickering] Is that\u2026 Boudicca's a name? All right.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And the owl very specifically makes eye contact with you, and": null, "once you're locked in it just [coughs softly].": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Are you all right?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it barfs out an owl pellet.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh, shit. [laughing]": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Am I supposed to touch that?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It takes a step back.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Hell no, dog. Hell no, I ain't gonna touch that. I ain't gonna": null, "touch the thing you threw up. No!": null, "[owl trills]": null, "Jammer: No, I ain't gonna touch it!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It goes over and kicks it at you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I'm not gonna touch it, man, stop. All right, shit. Shit.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Whitney immediately checks his pockets for any sort of napkin, and": null, "of course there is not one [laughing] 'cause I'm at basketball practice,": null, "and he's just gonna reach down and pick up this wet owl pellet.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yep, hot, wet, and warm.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh my god. Whitney immediately puts it in his pocket.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Don't tell anybody I picked that up.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The moment you\u2026 It mean mugs you back.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Man, ay, what? What, owl? What?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it starts to turn, its head turns.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0All right, all right, I ain't trying to fight no big bird right": null, "now. So, I'm going to\u2026 I got in to this private-ass school?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[hoots] And it takes off, and as it sort of unfurls its wings,": null, "you see this thing has a six-foot wingspan. It is massive, and it just": null, "takes off and flies away.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Whit is gonna take a second, just kinda looking at the letter,": null, "looking up at this big bird as it flies away.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0[sighs] Man, private school is fuckin' weird.": null, "Lou: And is gonna walk inside.": null, "Jammer: I'ma ask everyone to circle up real quick.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The coach is like, in the middle of a drill.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Coach, Coach, Coach, hold up, hold up. I need to talk to": null, "everybody.": null, "Coach:\u00a0Can I come, too?": null, "Coach:\u00a0Oh, okay, cool. All right, come on, everybody.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And they all circle up around you like,": null, "Teammates:\u00a0All right, slam this plan, let's go.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Hey, so, you know, I love playing with y'all, you know I love my": null, "time here, but you know, I'm all about making it happen, you know? It's": null, "what we all want, and I'm trying to do what's best for myself, and you": null, "know, I feel like sometimes, you know, Coach, I love you, but sometimes": null, "I feel like I'm coaching the team and you're just kinda hanging out,": null, "Coach.": null, "Coach:\u00a0I do feel that also.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, yeah. [laughing] So, you know, I've been looking\u2026 I was": null, "talking to my moms about going to private schools with some of the": null, "better programs, and you know, this isn't one of the ones I applied to,": null, "but that big bird just told me that I got into a dope-ass private school": null, "that I'ma be teleported to with a woman named Boudicca. [laughing] I": null, "guess this is how I say-": null, "Teammate: Yo, did anyone give him a concussion? What is happening?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Nah, nah. No, the big bird is real, I talked\u2026 You wanna see some": null, "shit? You wanna see some real shit? Y'all wanna see some real shit? I": null, "picked up\u2026 It threw up this nasty shit and I picked it up and I touched": null, "it, all right? This is some real shit.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0As you waggle it, a vole skull drops off of the edge of it and": null, "hits the ground.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0See? This is some-": null, "Teammate:\u00a0Yo! Okay. Don't have that in here. What are you\u2026 Go away. Get\u2026": null, "You know what? You need to go home. Go home.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0All right. Yeah, you know what? I need to take the day.": null, "Teammate:\u00a0Take your little... The bit that fell... Ew.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you just see a bunch of dudes daintily try to kick it": null, "without getting their shoes dirty.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, hey man, yeah. Get that... Nah, I don't want it either.": null, "Teammate:\u00a0I don't like that.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I pick it up and put it...": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I don't think that's an essential piece of the letter, but okay,": null, "yeah, I'ma get out of here 'cause it said I gotta get something signed": null, "by my moms anyway. But I'll see y'all. Y'all keep practicing. Let's make": null, "sure we gotta get that triangle offense tight for Jefferson on Saturday.": null, "I still am gonna finish out the year with y'all, but you know, next year": null, "I'ma be at the bird school.": null, "Teammate:\u00a0Okay. Well, I'm very happy... [to another teammate] No, no,": null, "no, I heard about this before where you have to go with it for a little": null, "bit so they feel better.

This is exciting stuff, dude.": null, "Teammate:\u00a0This is very nice for you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0This is big. They keep talking about me as being magical. I'm": null, "one with the rock, so, this is just real stuff\uff0d": null, "Aabria:\u00a0One of the freshmen starts to cry, like,": null, "Freshman:\u00a0I looked up to you!": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Dude, I mean, it's probably not further than Highland Park,": null, "right?

This is weird shit. But hey, private school is": null, "crazy, all right? They got juice and shit in the fountains, so I think": null, "that's the thing.": null, "Freshman:\u00a0You should bring some juice back, though. When you come to": null, "visit, bring some juice.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Bro, you don't think I'm going in with a couple bottles to take": null, "that fountain juice home with me?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That little freshman runs off and comes back with a Gatorade": null, "bottle, empties\u00a0out some water.": null, "Freshman:\u00a0Bring back juice.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Bro, I'ma\u00a0fill this up with juice from our water fountains.": null, "Freshman:\u00a0Yes, all right.

And as you head out and away, we follow another identical": null, "owl, massive tawny flying across, and you see the Space Needle across": null, "its wings as it heads over to the home of Karen Tanaka.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Karen is in her bedroom. There's posters of My Chemical Romance": null, "on the walls. [rock music] There's a multi-monitor setup with all the": null, "RGB lights.

[slamming] [gasping]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The owl kind of picks itself up, you see one pupil's kinda": null, "blasted and the other... It's a little concussed. Kinda gets up.": null, "[exhales] It has a massive envelope in its beak and it sort of taps": null, "lightly on the window trying to like... It's a freshly cleaned window,": null, "so it is absolutely stymied by what's happening.

Yes. I always knew I was special.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It slowly releases the envelope from the beak and then kind of": null, "backs away from you.": null, "Dream:\u00a0This is it. Yes. Yes.": null, "Erika:\u00a0She opens it slowly, reverently, taking a moment to stop by and": null, "post a status, saying,": null, "Dream:\u00a0Fuck you guys.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I always knew magic was real!": null, "Erika:\u00a0And logging, just logging out of the account forever.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yup.": null, "Erika:\u00a0She opens up the envelope, peruses the letter inside.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0As you begin to read it, the owl also begins to give the same": null, "speech, and then you hear halfway through, a knock on your door.": null, "Janet:\u00a0Sweetie, what's that\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0What is it, Janet?": null, "Janet:\u00a0You know I don't like when you call me Janet. Mom, mother.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Parental unit.": null, "Janet:\u00a0Weirder, but I will accept that. Your TV's a little loud. What's": null, "going on?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Ugh. You wouldn't get it, okay? Just stay out of my business!": null, "Janet:\u00a0Whoa, that's a lot of... Do you wanna talk about... I'm coming": null, "in.": null, "Dream:\u00a0No, don't come in!": null, "Janet:\u00a0I knocked, I respected your boundary.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she opens up the door and your mom, she looks like you, but": null, "with a nice high bun. She's wearing all of her nice little pantsuit.": null, "Both your parents are professors at the University of Washington, so she": null, "kind of just comes in and sits on your bed and gives you a little pat,": null, "and is looking right at you, and it's not until she sits down that she": null, "looks over and sees a massive owl standing in the window sill.": null, "Janet:\u00a0Oh, god! [laughs] What?": null, "Dream:\u00a0I got accepted into the magical school that I told you that I'd": null, "probably get my letter for.

What are we doing? What is this?": null, "Dream:\u00a0An acceptance to a magical school. You know?": null, "Maurice:\u00a0Is that a craft? I'm very proud of you.

It's like all your piercings and the tattoos that you've": null, "got.": null, "Dream:\u00a0God, why do you have to be so lame all the time?": null, "Maurice:\u00a0What? I just thought we talked about this.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Look. Respect my boundaries, please.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0No touching.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Respect that you don't understand what's going on.

I have five friends.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Your content is solid, yes.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0Thank you.": null, "Dream:\u00a0That's beside the point. I'm going to a magical school and you": null, "can't stop me.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0We would never stop you if you went to a magical school. What's": null, "this really about? Are you getting bullied at school? Is that what's": null, "happening? Do we-": null, "Dream:\u00a0No! I'm doing most of the cyberbullying, thank you very much.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0Please don't be a bully. Don't do that. Do we need to do": null, "something with the internet?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Okay, I'm sorry, I misspoke. It's less bullying and more keeping": null, "people accountable.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0Mm. You know what\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0In a very aggressive and effective manner.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0No, I hear you, and it's funny because all of those... I": null, "understand that growing up around us you have a certain set of": null, "terminology that you like. Right words, wrong attitude? Is that a thing": null, "I can say? It just doesn't feel quite right the way you've said that,": null, "though I feel like I should agree.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I'm gonna check with the group chat if that is acceptable": null, "language.": null, "Maurice:\u00a0Okay. Go ahead and check with the group chat.

Look. This is... It seems legit, you know?": null, "Maurice:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Dream:\u00a0And come on, it's just like I always talked about on the forums,": null, "you know? When I was 11 and I was like, \"Where's my owl?

Don't like that word either.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And as your father goes and starts reading, the moment he picks": null, "up at the top, the bird begins again and your mother lets out a sound.": null, "[cheerful music] I don't know if you hear it right away, but the dogs in": null, "the neighborhood start to just howl as she's just staring down the owl": null, "like.

What?": null, "Dream:\u00a0I mean, come on, you went to all the \"Harry Potter\" movies with": null, "me and everything.": null, "Janet:\u00a0Yes, but those are movies and that's, oh my fuck, that's...": null, "[laughs exasperatedly]": null, "Dream:\u00a0Pull it together, Janet.": null, "Janet:\u00a0Okay, you're handling this too well. I think I'm taking this the": null, "right way. Maurice! Why are you still... Okay, okay, okay.

I'm clearly going to wherever... Where is": null, "it? Where did you say this was?": null, "Erika:\u00a0And I turn to the owl.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And as your dad goes back to read it, the owl addresses you.": null, "Owl: Gowpenny Academy of Arcane Arts.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Gowpenny Academy of Arcane Arts.

She's got her": null, "microphone. It used to be where her mom kept all the stuff from her": null, "multilevel marketing scheme where she sold tights to her friends from": null, "high school. So, you can still see the tights and all the things in": null, "boxes that her mom has tried to sell. There's some vitamins just": null, "everywhere.[laughing] But you can see neatly carved out with all of": null, "those behind, Sam is doing a mukbang while she talks to all of her many": null, "followers. And she is eating, for no good reason other than everyone": null, "else is doing it, she's eating a meal of sausages, rice, and cucumbers,": null, "and she has an idea of why everyone is doing it, but she's just gonna": null, "let that pass.

But": null, "yeah, for some reason for some people it's really soothing to watch": null, "people eat, or it just kinda feels like it's kinda your buddy or your": null, "friend.": null, "Erika:\u00a0It's like social eating.": null, "Lou:\u00a0It's like having a meal with someone.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yeah, it's like being on Zoom and \u201chaving dinner with a friend\u201d.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Great. [points at camera] You're welcome. [laughing] 'Cause you": null, "were wondering, too. Don't act like you know better. Don't act, don't": null, "act like you knew and I didn't.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Literally everyone but you knows what that is.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh, stop! Not a chance! [points at Brennan] You mouthed it. Don't-": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I had no idea what that is.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0No!": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I have no clue what that is.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I don't like it. Collusion at the table. We all got it 'cause we": null, "know what's good. And as we sort of sweep away from that scene, a camera": null, "pans and zooms thousands of miles away back towards the Midwest, but not": null, "towards any city, towards a wide open plain and endless rows of corn and": null, "soybeans as we get to Millersburg, Iowa. And this owl that looks tired,": null, "confused, deeply upset at the utter lack of trees in the available area": null, "for perching and just vibing, where does this owl find Evan?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0So, I'm Evan Kelmp.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0I almost spit out my water.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Just the name.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Just the name.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0K-E-L-M-P, Kelmp.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooh. It's too many consonants. [laughing]": null, "Erika:\u00a0It leaves your mouth in that, oh.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Kelmp.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Kelmp.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Kelmp.": null, "Lou: [sticking his tongue out]\u00a0Kelmp.": null, "Erika:\u00a0You swallow it, it's a name you swallow.": null, "Lou:\u00a0You swallow it, yeah.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0You do swallow it. I think Evan is currently probably walking": null, "down the road. I'm sleeping right now at an available cot\uff0d in one of": null, "the non-used bunks at Camp Lonefield. There are a lot of summer camps in": null, "the area that don't have max capacity and you can usually find a cot or": null, "a bunk in one of the bunkhouses that is not currently being used by a": null, "rented camp service. I'm over six feet but slouched below six feet, very": null, "much from the Adam Driver school of\u2026 coin flip if you think he's": null, "handsome or spooky looking.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Could be both.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Could be both. And I have just a white T-shirt, khakis that are": null, "way too long for my already long legs and are kind of accordioned around": null, "these seemingly brandless chunky sneakers.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, no. Kirkland brand sneakers.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Rubber Casio watch, waterproof watch, pockets bulging with": null, "belongings. Just a grocery bag with T-shirts, socks, and underwear in": null, "it. And I'm just walking down the highway.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh my god.": null, "Lou:\u00a0That's the saddest thing I've heard today.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I've ever heard. Wrap the game.": null, "Lou:\u00a0There you go. Congratulations. Look at you.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I can't do this.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Hey, there you go.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You did it. And this bird sort of flies overhead and sees you,": null, "and then sort of breaks its pattern and comes back around, but then": null, "begins circling, less like an owl and more like a vulture. And that's": null, "when you notice it overhead. What do you do?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0[looks up and speaks quietly] Stand very still. Has the bird": null, "gotten close enough to me that I'm able to see any defining traits or": null, "characteristics? Can I see features of this bird?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah. The sun's sort of setting, so you're in that weird hour": null, "where shadows are starting to get a little bigger. So, it slowly comes": null, "down a little bit and now it's about 20 feet overhead, and you see that": null, "it's holding a big envelope in its beak and looking down at you with": null, "eyes that, you know what owls look like. You have a lot of time of": null, "just\u00a0looking out of windows and imagining whatever happens behind those": null, "eyes. And its pupils, there's no gold, there's no color to it, it's": null, "completely black.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, hello, friend. You're not native to this region. You're a": null, "completely different kind of owl. Oh, boy. Are you gonna be weird, or": null, "will you be normal?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[laughs] Even though you're whispering and it's high in the air,": null, "it swoops around one more time before landing in front of you in the": null, "highway. There's no cars coming at all. You'd be able to see for a solid": null, "mile in every direction. It's so fucking flat. And this bird is 20 feet": null, "away, and puts the envelope down and spreads out its wings and bows to": null, "Evan:\u00a0Don't bow. Don't do that, that's so weird. Please don't do that.": null, "Don't do that.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It holds.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay. [stuttering] What do you want? Is that for me, the letter?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It kind of leans up again and you see it blink, and it blinks": null, "and the eyes switch between that all black and then a normal, sort of": null, "golden iris-ed thing and then back to black, and it flits back and forth": null, "between the two. And it gives a little weird nod and begins to sort of": null, "jerkily back away from you.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay. Is that normal for you, or is a weird thing happening to": null, "you?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You see in the way it's ruffled, it doesn't seem super": null, "comfortable with anything that's happening right now.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay. You don't have to stay for whatever's happening. [laughing]": null, "You don't have to stay, you can go. I know that I'm bad. I know I'm bad": null, "to be around. You can go if this is not good for you.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Okay, I'm gonna pick up the letter. And I go pick up the letter": null, "from the ground.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[laughs] As you pick it up, the bird kind of gets up and seems": null, "to shake off whatever effect was keeping it jerky and inconsistent. Its": null, "eyes return to that normal golden look, and it waits patiently looking": null, "at you. Make a Charm roll for me, difficulty of 10.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0That's never gonna happen.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Hey, we saw magic earlier on that side of the table, okay?": null, "Danielle holds her hands up in a \u2018who, me?\u2019 gesture.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Magic!": null, "Lou:\u00a0Let's go, this side. Here we go. Explode, explode.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0This is my d4. [blows] Let\u2019s hit that 10.": null, "Lou:\u00a0We're going big, we're going big.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You can do it.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It's a hot two. [laughing]": null, "Lou:\u00a0That's not it. Ya-da-da.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0As you pick it up, you make unfortunate eye contact with this": null, "bird and it screeches at you.": null, "Lou holds his hand over his heart.": null, "Evan:\u00a0You're an owl, why are you scared of me? [owl screeching] Please": null, "go! You don't have to be... I can't guarantee your safety either, so": null, "leave!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you actually see, its wings instinctively go out as if it": null, "wants to take off, and then it slowly tucks itself back in.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Fine, fine, I'll read it fast.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It has to stay.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'll read it fast, I'll read it fast.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I open the letter.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0As you open the letter, you hear a little [hissing] but it's not": null, "a sound coming from the envelope, it's just an envelope. You hear": null, "something behind your mind hiss with appreciation as you begin to read.": null, "And the bird's voice, an elderly British woman's voice comes out and": null, "reads your acceptance to Gowpenny Academy of the Arcane Arts.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay. Okay. The section about legal guardians or parents, do we": null, "need a signature to affirm that we don't have any? Or does that-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0The owl sort of extends its neck and shakes its head a little": null, "bit.": null, "Evan:\u00a0So, that can be returned blank and that's not gonna gum up any": null, "paperwork?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it just sort of nods.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay. Well, I'm happy to save some bureaucratic [laughs weakly].": null, "Lou:\u00a0That's the saddest laugh I've ever heard. I was like, is that a": null, "laugh? Is that? I'm not sure that counts.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay, but this is real? This is not an illusion or a mean trick?": null, "This is real.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And the bird sort of reluctantly begins to step forward towards": null, "you. And once it reaches within five feet of you, its eyes go black": null, "again and it goes to barf up that teleportation owl pellet, but a": null, "splatter of black ichor comes out first.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Just please, I know you don't owe me any favors, but I'm gonna": null, "make eye contact with you. Please just make a little owl face like": null, "that's how that always go. Just make a little owl face that you always": null, "spit up some blood when you do that. I'm gonna look at you in three.": null, "One, two, three.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0180 degrees.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Looking in the other direction.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'm so sorry. Do you have any other responsibilities or tasks that": null, "you need to fulfill? You can go, if you need to.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You hear a shudder come out of this bird's mouth and lungs as it": null, "takes off and up and just fucks off entirely from your whole situation.": null, "It seems to dip, and it takes a little bit to get its bearings again in": null, "the air and it flaps away. And you eventually lose it across the horizon": null, "line. And it's out of eyeshot and earshot, so you don't hear the": null, "strangled sound it makes when it is snatched out of the air and": null, "disappears from view.": null, "Brennan\u2019s jaw is dropped.": null, "Aabria: And something laughs menacingly.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I don't hear that?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You don't. You don't. You don't!": null, "Lou:\u00a0You missed that part.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You missed that part. Do you wanna try to hear it?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Yeah, I would love to try.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, okay. Give me a Brains roll. Let's make that difficult.": null, "It's gotta be hard 'cause I did say it didn't happen. But it could": null, "happen. Let's go a difficulty of 12. It's doable.": null, "Lou:\u00a0It's doable.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0It's doable.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Do you have to explode?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I don't have to explode, I have a one in six chance of hitting": null, "it on the die.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0All right.": null, "Lou:\u00a0You know the odds.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0He did that math so fast in his head.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0[rests his chin on his hands] That's gonna be another hot two.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Don't forget, when you fail a roll, give yourself an Adversity": null, "token.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Oh, I failed two so far.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0There you go.": null, "Lou:\u00a0[claps] Hey man, you're banking.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ay!": null, "Lou:\u00a0You're failing forward, there you go.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I think I totally miss any of that and I just go like,": null, "Evan:\u00a0Did it fly here from England?

Okay, I'll break the tension.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0No. I do wanna know where this is going. Go ahead.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I was going to say, so, each of us was approached by an owl, the": null, "same owl?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I mean-": null, "Evan:\u00a0Different owl?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Mine didn't vomit blood.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0If we probably had the same owl, if we both tried to fight it-": null, "Sam:\u00a0Ornery owl.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Same triflin' owl.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Oh. They're magical owls, they all look the same. They're": null, "different owls.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, interesting. But yeah, I received it. This is the first time": null, "I've had confirmation that the world-": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0You're special. [slow music]": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah, maybe that. Is there a... Is there a... Sorry, [laughs": null, "nervously] I don't really think about it, I guess special is correct in": null, "the most technical sense. But I haven't spoken to an adult about the": null, "services that the academy offers, we just sort of got this letter.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Yes, I'm the adult.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Is there a\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0Well, I assume that we go and get our stuff and then we go to": null, "this magical whimsical academy and then have grand adventures.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yes?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Oh, are you a divination specialist?": null, "Dream:\u00a0No, I read \"Harry Potter\".": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Read what?": null, "Dream:\u00a0\"Harry Potter\".": null, "Evan:\u00a0You gotta know.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Did you not see the movies?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0See the what?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0The movies? I didn't see most of them, I saw three and five, and": null, "then I saw the first part of six.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Three is definitely the best one.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0It's the... Yeah, it was cool.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0I don't know what you're\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0Wait, no. Okay.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Movies. What's movie?": null, "Dream:\u00a0So, let's get a little baseline here. \"Lord of the Rings\"?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0There's definitely a bunch of rings. That's a magical": null, "artifacts that exists in our world.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Holy shit. Billie Eilish.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0[pause] Eilish. No, we have a Billy Frumpshire.

[to other teens] Are they completely": null, "cut off from the actual world?": null, "Sam:\u00a0I was gonna ask if she knew what a McRib was, but if she doesn't": null, "understand that then she's not gonna understand anything.": null, "Evan:\u00a0They have McDonald's here. By the way, the cone is incredible.": null, "Most of the desserts are actually higher calorie than the meal items on": null, "the value menu.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0They're so good.": null, "Evan:\u00a0So good.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I feel like you know that for the wrong reasons, but they're so": null, "good.

Thank you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, sorry about that.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0My god.": null, "Dream:\u00a0This is all supposed to be secret, right?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Dream:\u00a0So, it seems like a lot of things are pretty dead-on from the": null, "\"Harry Potter\" universe. You don't have anybody controlling that or": null, "monitoring any sort of supernatural gotcha force?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0I don't know what [sighs] most of the words you said meant, so": null, "I will not respond to them. No. There is no one here by the name of a": null, "Harold Potter. I'll go and check with our ministry to see if there's": null, "anyone registered under that name.

They literally have-": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0A what?": null, "Dream:\u00a0[groans] Okay, well all right. What are next steps, then?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Well, hold on.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she produces from a tiny pouch four big bags of coins and": null, "hands one to each of you.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Here's 20 gold.

Can we not say it on the radio, or?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0What's a radio?": null, "Dream puts her hands together in a bid for patience.": null, "Jammer: No way. No way. Come on.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0What?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0The radio? You don't know the radio?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Is that like a musician?": null, "Evan:\u00a0What I don't understand is, even using pens and paper is a form of": null, "technology, so medieval wizards would have been up to date on the most": null, "progressed technology of their age, and then at some point made the": null, "decision to just become increasingly more anachronistic over time? You": null, "are hearkening back to a time that very much was the present in its": null, "moment, why not stay in the present as time advances along with magic?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yeah, like do you have indoor plumbing?": null, "The Headmistress does not reply.": null, "Dream: Oh my god!": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0What? We have magic!": null, "Jammer:\u00a0You can't... I'm\uff0d": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0We have pumps, like pipes for water, but\uff0d": null, "Sam:\u00a0Where do you poop?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Oh, you just magic it away. Wherever you want.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh, fuck.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Hey, I wanna go home. I wanna go home. I'm not gonna magic away": null, "my business, all right? Y\u2019know? I was excited to be here and to play for": null, "you guys, but if I'ma have to\uff0d": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Play?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah. I'm assuming y'all have... I wasn't sure if y'all": null, "recruited me for basketball or baseball.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0[sighs] I feel like we're gonna keep doing this thing where I": null, "don't know what you're talking about. We have our own sports here.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Probably soccer. Football.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, it's probably soccer. Football. Football, that's it. Do you": null, "have a sport?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0We do. It'll all be explained to you later. Honestly, I...": null, "This is taking up way more time than I expected. I wanted to show you a": null, "whole magical world and I have other meetings to deal with.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh yeah.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Sorry about that.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0No, you're fine.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Sorry, sorry.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Sorry.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Sorry, yeah.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Quick, here's a speed run for you all. You are all Americans.": null, "You're part of a pilot project of, you know, expanding magical... Hey,": null, "you know what? The more you know, the weirder it is. Just know that": null, "there's a lot of people out there counting on you to show up, do what it": null, "is in your nature to do, and we're all gonna have a lovely term. Yes?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Good. Well, I... Ring, ring.": null, "[ringing]": null, "Aabria: And a little owl appears, like a tiny purple owl appears, like": null, "\"Oh, look at that,\" and she grabs a little scroll off of it, like,": null, "Philtrum: Pressing business, only a day left until the term starts\uff0d": null, "Evan:\u00a0So, the ringing is a reference to telephones.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Owls don't ring in the wild. I don't wanna be Mr. Bird Facts all": null, "the time, but owls don't ring naturally.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Well, no. Because a lot of people don't like touching owls": null, "'cause they've always been filthy creatures, a lot of them wear bells": null, "around their neck.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Then why do you use them as your primary mode of communication?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Because they're easy to replicate in transfiguration, a thing": null, "you'll learn very, very soon.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Am I getting a vibe that the teacher's about to leave in a": null, "second?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yup! Trying to.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I'm going to look at the other three and be like,": null, "Evan:\u00a0Well, it seems like the teacher wants to leave\uff0d": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Headmistress. Head of the whole school.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Headmistress, sorry. Could I have just a quick conversation with": null, "you in a moment?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Yeah, sure.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0That's totally cool. Will you just ask her what we're supposed": null, "to get? I just don't... I mean, I got my ball and I got all of my\uff0d": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0I can hear you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Well, what do we need? I got my ball and I got my shirts\uff0d": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0What's a ball?": null, "Dream:\u00a0I assume that it's going to be a wand\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0And a cauldron, and a familiar, I'm probably gonna get something": null, "really cool like a dragon or a phoenix.": null, "Jammer: Oh, shit, they got those?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Wand, familiar, broom,supplies that you need. The school also": null, "has them, so books if you're a person that wants to have your own copy.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Which of these items are mandatory for us to acquire?": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Wand, familiar, broom.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I brought my own crystals.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Are we suppo\u2014 okay.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Me, too.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0From... Oh, that's just a piece... Mm, no it's fine. Good for": null, "you. I'm very proud of you, and I'm sure your rocks are very magical.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Crystals.": null, "Sam:\u00a0They're called crystals.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Yes. Pardon me. Mr. Kelmp.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Thank you.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0She touches your shoulder and kind of regrets it.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Hi.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And I think I don't wanna leave these new kids that I": null, "immediately have something in common with, but I just go like,": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'm happy to go and acquire those items, but this may end up being": null, "a waste of time. I understand that there's sort of a track that we're on": null, "right now. I probably won't need a wand or a familiar or a broom or": null, "anything like that.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Mr. Kelmp, why would you believe that?": null, "Evan:\u00a0Well, this is all... It seems like they're part of sort of a plan": null, "that's happening, but I would really love to talk to any medical": null, "specialist or anything like that. I've never had an adult that": null, "understood that magic was real, and I've suspected it's been real for a": null, "long, long time.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0You're home now.": null, "Evan:\u00a0So, I just really need someone to... It would be... I would prefer": null, "to be non-magical.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Oh, god no, no.": null, "Evan:\u00a0So, if there's any-": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0No, no one would ever choose that.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I would.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Well, you're young and American and very stressful. My dear": null, "Evan, anyone that's been selected to attend Gowpenny would cut off a": null, "limb to be able to do so, and I highly recommend that you see this as an": null, "opportunity. Magic is not something you want to get rid of.": null, "Evan:\u00a0[harshly] You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Excuse me?": null, "Evan:\u00a0You heard what I said. [snorts] [normal voice] Sorry, sorry. I uh,": null, "um... Maybe\uff0d": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she pulls out a set of glasses and sets of three extra": null, "colored lenses and gets really close to your face and goes,": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0[clicking, sound of pain] Oh. Ooh.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Maybe I could just have a meeting with a school nurse, or": null, "something, when we get to the academy.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0You know what? We'll have a consultation when you get there.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Thank you. I really appreciate it.": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0Yes. But for now, relax, try to enjoy yourself. This is a": null, "magical time in any young mage's life. Try to enjoy it, will you?": null, "Evan: [whispering] Please don't tell me what to do.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she says something in a tone that you know you understand": null, "but your brain can't translate, and that deep part of you says,": null, "Part of Evan:\u00a0I know exactly who I'm talking to, and your time hasn't": null, "come yet.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I'm terrified. Evan just starts sweating.": null, "Dream:\u00a0So, I call it the Superb Owl because it's making fun of the fact": null, "that it is, you know, that\uff0d": null, "Philtrum:\u00a0[claps] I'm leaving, everyone should acknowledge that. You'll": null, "be fine. Head to the school and I'll see you there. Don't forget, wand,": null, "broom, familiar, anything else you want. And there's plenty of people": null, "here, there's probably other students running around at some point, so": null, "you'll be fine. I trust you all implicit-\" and before she can finish the": null, "word, it's like when you hang up the phone a little bit too soon, she": null, "disappears mid-sentence.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Okay. Well, listen here my Muggles.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0We've got each other, all right? And this is the team, this is": null, "the squad right here, all right? I got your back, I got your back, I got": null, "your back, right? Now, does anyone know... The lack of sports and, I": null, "don't know, everybody's talking really fast and normally there's a coach": null, "to walk me through this. So, I'm just gonna follow you.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I have the perfect blueprint for this. I know everything that": null, "there is to know about potential magical item shopping.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I am so excited right now. Yes. I think that we should probably": null, "hit up our wands first because you know, it's like the manifestation of": null, "our magic, it's gonna choose us.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Okay, that sounds good to me. What is manifest... We'll talk later.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0So, you all turn down this beautiful alley full of a bunch of": null, "amazing stores, and you're able to wander down, weaving between magical": null, "folk on their normal errands for a day until you arrive at a massive": null, "storefront that kind of reminds you of a big-box store, it just has a": null, "very bland font, purple fonted, \"Ace of Wands\" in front of it. It's": null, "clean, symmetrical, neutrally-toned, and you know that this is where you": null, "need to be.": null, "Dream:\u00a0This looks like a Walmart for wands or something.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Wandmart, yeah.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, Wandmart. Yeah, well. Let's go get it.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I can't wait. I bet mine's gonna have something like a phoenix": null, "feather, or you know, I don't know, a unicorn spleen, I guess.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Wow.": null, "Sam:\u00a0That's really cool.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah. I'm probably gonna get something pretty just sturdy and": null, "good, you know? Something that won't break.": null, "Sam:\u00a0I think mine's probably made of wood, right? Like I think it\u2019s": null, "probably a wood wand, right? Just wood.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, yeah. If that's a parameter, that's gonna really be able to": null, "happen, for sure.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Oh, good!": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah, absolutely.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you all pass through the doors that magically open for you.": null, "And you hear a gently tinkling chimes as you pass within, fully": null, "expecting what years of magical books and movies have taught you is the": null, "experience of finally finding the thing that chooses you and induct you": null, "into a magical world. And you all close your eyes and embrace whatever's": null, "coming next. And as you open your eyes, all four of you are standing": null, "back on the outside, facing back into the street, experience immediately": null, "forgotten, with a box in your hands. Please look under your chairs.": null, "[Brennan screams]": null, "Lou:\u00a0No you didn't.": null, "[Erika screaming]": null, "Lou: No you didn't. What? [gasping] Wow!": null, "Sam:\u00a0Oh my god.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And all of you that were expecting a beautiful, curated,": null, "specialized wand come out with the same wooden stick. [laughing]": null, "Sam:\u00a0It's wood!": null, "Evan:\u00a0This is beautiful.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0All right, yeah. Did we all get the same one?": null, "Dream:\u00a0[angry] There's supposed to be like, a skull, or something metal!": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, didn't you say something about a spleen? This just looks\uff0d": null, "Evan:\u00a0I think this is... Well, it's light.": null, "Evan:\u00a0This is a good dowel. There's definitely worse dowels than this.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Cool. Well.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I'm gonna check the 20 gold coins in my pocket, and how many": null, "are left in there?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, just by a feel? Can you hold a bag and know how much money's": null, "in it?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Oh, I don't think I can do it by feel, I just wanna check how": null, "many...

Maybe I did agree and they erased my memory?": null, "Dream:\u00a0This was supposed... This chose me? It's so, like, mundie! Ugh!": null, "Evan is experimentally wiggling his wand.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think Jammer's gonna just point it at Sam and just flick it and": null, "see if anything happens.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Hey! Don\u2019t\uff0d": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What are you trying to do?": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think it's truly in his head as just the idea of, does this work?": null, "And just flicks it at Sam.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0In Jammer's mind's eye, what does he expect to see if it goes": null, "off?": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think he expects to see some kind of white... He expects to see": null, "something shoot out of it. [laughing] I now realize, when I said it was": null, "a white mist.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That'll lower the DC 'cause that's pretty right in the": null, "expectations, yeah, that's fair.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Yeah. Something's just gonna shoot out of the end of his wand.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I think I'm gonna call that a Grit roll for no good reason.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Difficulty of six.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Six, all right.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Add your Magic die.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh, and my Magic die. [chuckles] That is exactly a six.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you sort of flick it casually, and just a little [puffs] of": null, "like baby powder, just heavily scented baby powder that actually smells": null, "like a fresh basketball, so just leather, but new and full of potential,": null, "just sort of [puffs] in your direction.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, shit. They work!": null, "Evan: Were you attempting to do something? Or you just sort of flicked": null, "it.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I just flicked it, and I was like": null, "[yelling]": null, "Jammer: Oh. I was trying to see if it worked, and then it just, yeah.": null, "Sorry about that. I didn't know what was gonna happen.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Cool. That's super cool.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I think Evan takes a belt off of his khakis that now are trying": null, "to fall down, and ties it around, put the wand back in the box, ties the": null, "box, goes,": null, "Evan:\u00a0This is so cool. We're all having a good time.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Well, try yours out.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Nope, that's fine. Hey, so we should get brooms or familiars next.": null, "I wonder if they have McDonald's in Vertic Alley.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah. I mean, if we pass one I'm definitely gonna get a cone.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Definitely.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I gotta wash that weird gamey sweetness out of my mouth.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh no! Do we only have American money here? Or would a": null, "McDonald's\uff0d": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I mean, I'm assuming. I guess they take big gold coins.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah. We should ask if they have a McDonald's 'cause that would be": null, "Dream:\u00a0I wanna try whimsical British wizard sweets or something. I'm not": null, "gonna have McDonalds while I'm here.

He doesn't know": null, "the Tumblr significance of that. He just knows the word for the emotion": null, "and goes,": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'm having the best time I've ever had in my life. I'm not sad": null, "right now.": null, "Dream:\u00a0[whispering] Are you gonna cry?": null, "Evan: Yeah, please stop making fun of me?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh my god.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Why's she acting like that?": null, "Sam: What's happening?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Why's she acting like it's cool that he's sad? We all know he's": null, "sad but we're not gonna say nothing about it.": null, "Evan: You do? Oh, shit.": null, "Sam: We don't say it out loud. You\u2019re saying the quiet part out loud.": null, "Evan: I'm literally... This is my best day.": null, "Sam: And you know, no one can take this away from you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Exactly. So, let's keep it rolling.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'm sorry I cried.": null, "Jammer: Let's get a broom, that sounds cool.": null, "Evan: Let's get a broom.": null, "Jammer: Yeah, let's get a broom.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Jammer, as you are gesticulating with your wand, you notice as": null, "you reassert your grip that that generic wooden dowel, you look down and": null, "the material of it around the base has changed, slightly darker wood.": null, "Bamboo.": null, "Jammer: Oh, shit. Wait, it's not as... It got... It's different. I think": null, "it's magic.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I try to do something. Mm.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, girl, whatcha trying to do?": null, "Erika:\u00a0I'm trying to get it to change to something cool, with like a": null, "snake. [laughing]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Oh, you're trying to make the wand be magic to itself, which is": null, "a...": null, "Dream:\u00a0Ha-ha!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, we're gonna call it a Fight 'cause that's an internal": null, "conflict. Give me a Fight roll, difficulty of 10 'cause that's a weird": null, "sell. Don't forget your Magic die.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Oh. Five.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0With a five, the wand remains inert.

And if anybody needs": null, "help with their whole magic thing, I'm 100%... If you, you know.": null, "Dream:\u00a0My latent abilities as a witch are probably just late in blooming": null, "because the flower that blooms in adversity is often the most complex": null, "and dark of them all.": null, "Evan:\u00a0That's a butchering of the quote from \"Mulan\", I think, right?": null, "Dream:\u00a0I made it better.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, okay.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0I take my wand and pull out lint or something that's in my": null, "pocket, and I go,": null, "Sam:\u00a0Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, and shit.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0And I hit it to try to see if I can do transmodification.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You're trying to\u2026 What are you trying to do? Turn the lint into?": null, "Danielle:\u00a0I'm trying to turn the lint into a delicious McDonald's": null, "sundae. [laughing] We are not sponsored.": null, "Erika: We are not sponsored.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Gosh darnit. 'Cause the worst part is, that is a charm spell.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Danielle:\u00a0[grinning]\u00a0Yeah, it is.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Because you're turning a non-edible substance into food, I'm": null, "gonna say the difficulty's a 15.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Okay. Come on, babe.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Don't forget your Magic die.": null, "Danielle:\u00a0Oh.

Yeah, hell yeah.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh my god, you guys are so good at magic. That was incredible. Did": null, "you know you could do that?": null, "Sam:\u00a0No! [holds up her wand] It's this thingy, it's all this. You guys,": null, "you know, thank you so much for being so sweet. Don't forget to like and": null, "subscribe, but it's really just this that does all of the magic. It's": null, "not little old me.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Like and subscribe to what?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Her channel. It's dope, you should check it out.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I don't have a screen on my phone.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Aww.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I only have like, three numbers saved in there.": null, "Evan:\u00a0It's 911, poison control, and animal control.": null, "Dream:\u00a0[very loudly] Aww!": null, "Evan:\u00a0What's happening?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Well, you know, I don't know, maybe it's just a Black thing, I": null, "don't know. Maybe it's just a Black thing that we're good at magic.": null, "Sam: I don't know.": null, "Evan:\u00a0That makes sense to me. Yeah, I'm from Iowa and it's bad there.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0[laughing] Sam, by the way, as you're holding a McDonald's": null, "sundae, that's rapidly melting in the heat of your hand, so it went from": null, "cute and it's just... The half life on this is just not excellent. The": null, "wand in your hand, you look over, and the entire shaft of it is a little": null, "bit of a pinker wood.": null, "Sam: It changed, you see that?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yo.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Yo!": null, "Jammer:\u00a0You gotta cast a spell and then it becomes a cool wand.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, that's so cool. [pointing to Sam\u2019s sundae] If that's melting,": null, "do you want me to get rid of that?": null, "Sam:\u00a0Yeah! Let's see. You gonna magic it or are you just gonna grab it": null, "with your hand?": null, "Evan:\u00a0I was gonna eat it. I was walking on a highway earlier today.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0That was lint like, a minute ago.": null, "Evan is already shoving it into his mouth.": null, "Dream:\u00a0That is... Oh, it's already gone.": null, "Jammer: What'd it taste like? Did it taste real? Did it taste like the": null, "real thing?": null, "Evan: It tastes incredible. It tastes like a true sundae, it's amazing.": null, "There's the sauce on it and everything, that's incredible.": null, "Sam:\u00a0I could make sun... I could do that before with hands. But now I": null, "can do it with this!": null, "Jammer: Hell yeah.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Hell yeah.": null, "Evan reaches into his pocket and wipes his hand with a rag.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And as you guys are kind of just doing magic in a weird little": null, "circle at the\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0[looking at her wand] Okay, all right, well that was a bit of a": null, "strike-out, but you know, it's fine.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You see a group of other students that are kind of looking over": null, "at you, three of them.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sam waves and smiles.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0[waving] Sup?": null, "Evan waves.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Magical peers.": null, "Jammer: Should we go say hi?

We're the foreign exchange students": null, "from the pilot program.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0Oh, that. [chuckles] Well, that makes perfect... I get it.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And this is the one female in the trio that's speaking. She": null, "goes,": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0My name is Tallulah. It's nice to meet you. And we could tell": null, "that you were all Americans from, oh, just miles away. You all use": null, "miles.": null, "Dream:\u00a0You say that very condescendingly.": null, "Sam:\u00a0You think you're better than me?": null, "Dream:\u00a0That's fair, though. America is in a pretty bad spot right now.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0No, it's not that you're Americans, it's that you all are": null, "doing your first year of magical training, but you're all six, seven": null, "years older than the first year students, so that's weird for you. I": null, "don't think I'm better than you. I'm here, we're here... Sorry, let me": null, "introduce. Once again, Tallulah, this is Digsby and this is Fergus.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And they all kind of give you a little look.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0I'm sure you don't know anything about the houses or anything.": null, "We're all\uff0d": null, "[Dream gasps]": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0What?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh, it's just we get sorted into houses that are befitting our": null, "strengths, I assume.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0Oh. Looks like you've done some reading before. I like you.": null, "Good. Well, is there's anything the three of us could help you with as": null, "you're sort of running around making a ruckus about doing very small": null, "spells in the middle of a magical street? [laughs stiffly]": null, "Dream:\u00a0Again, condescending. You know we're new here, you know?": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0It's just how I sound. [laughs stiffly]": null, "Jammer: Well, we were wondering if there's a McDonald's here. That was": null, "the first question I think we had as a group.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And Tallulah looks over to her right at the one she introduced": null, "as Fergus, who's this taller ginger dude with a tan, freckly, kind of": null, "yoked up, of a height with you. He's been giving you the athlete to": null, "athlete eye like\uff0d": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Sup?": null, "Fergus:\u00a0Yeah. Yeah, sorry.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And pays attention to Tallulah, she also looks confused, he": null, "shrugs, and Digsby steps forward and goes,": null, "Digsby:\u00a0No, no, no, I'll handle it. I used to be non-magical person": null, "myself. Digsby again.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And he kind of walks forward, and he's pale, dark hair, pale": null, "green-gray eyes, and tosses his hair like,": null, "Digsby:\u00a0I remember McDonald's in the before time. No, we don't have": null, "those here, but don't worry, British food is much better than any fast": null, "food. Highly recommend you check out the Knave's Navel if you want to": null, "grab a bite to eat. It's just around the corner there.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Maybe they got some of those sweets you're looking for.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I'm so excited to be learning abroad.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0It is pretty cool to be in a different country. [gestures to": null, "Evan] I also, I've never been outside of... Well, I've been around for": null, "tournaments and stuff, but I've never been out of the Midwest, so-": null, "Digsby:\u00a0Oh, I'm gonna need us to be focused on this thing that's": null, "happening. This is not\uff0d": null, "Evan:\u00a0You're from the Midwest? Where are you from?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, Chicago.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, that's awesome. I'm from Iowa, but-": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, I've competed... I've done tournaments down there and": null, "stuff.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh, that's great. You ever been near Millersburg?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0No.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Is that cool? I don't-": null, "Evan:\u00a0No, I-": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I've just mostly done the tournaments in Des Moines and stuff.": null, "Evan: Oh, Des Moines is great. I lived in Des Moines very briefly. I've": null, "sort of bounced around in different spots in Iowa for a while,": null, "[Digsby clears his throat]": null, "Evan: But there's a lot of-": null, "Digsby:\u00a0I'm sorry. It's not that we're on schedule or anything, but": null, "we're kind of a big deal. And we just... If there's anything we could do": null, "for you in this sort of immediate... It's a student outreach thing. Just": null, "don't ignore us is all I'm saying. Thank you.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I have so many questions. I'm sure that all of us have very many": null, "questions. Do we have you sort of a, you know, like an RA basis once we": null, "get to the school and everything? Also, which is the really ambitious,": null, "dark house, and everything? 'Cause that's probably the one that I'm": null, "gonna get sorted into. You have some sort of sorting,I don't know, hat,": null, "maybe?": null, "Digsby:\u00a0[laughing] A hat? That's ridiculous, you would put on a hat and": null, "it would tell you.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Well, how do you do it?": null, "Digsby:\u00a0You'll see. It's supposed to be a surprise.": null, "Fergus:\u00a0You step on the little\uff0d": null, "Digsby:\u00a0Don't tell. It's lovely. And you know what? If you end up being": null, "in Hercinil, then yes, I'll be happy to take you under my wing.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Interesting.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0We gotta get a familiar and a broom. Is there a place that does": null, "that on the cheap?": null, "Digsby:\u00a0Oh, yeah. Yeah, follow me. And you're also gonna need some robes": null, "'cause those are interesting outfits. Your shoes are so bright. Why are": null, "they those colors?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Well yeah, these are the Irvings.": null, "Digsby:\u00a0Irving? What's an Irving?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Kyrie Irving. The basketball player? I mean, at this point why": null, "do I even think you know what I'm talking about?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And Digsby's like,": null, "Digsby:\u00a0I get what basketball is.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, okay, thank you. Yeah, well no, these are just his": null, "sneakers. These are the Electro-Lights.": null, "Digsby:\u00a0Sneakers?": null, "Whitner:\u00a0They're really sick.": null, "Digsby:\u00a0Sick Electro-Lights?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yeah, I'm not gonna wear...": null, "\u00a0Lou: What kinda shoes are they wearing?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Electrolytes are a scientific principle. I mean, okay.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Well, it\u2019s kind of a play on that 'cause it's like, Electro,": null, "hyphen, Light. You know.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Dream:\u00a0So it was me that was ignorant about this facet of culture.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Nobody needs to know what's going on with sneakers.

I could dunk on all of them, so I'm not really fazed.": null, "Evan:\u00a0That was, yeah. I'm sorry I didn't say anything back there about": null, "it, I was just trying to breathe and not get mad.": null, "Dream:\u00a0There's a lot going on.

It's making me upset, you know?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Hey man, well you know, game face. If somebody tries to talk you": null, "down, tries to sun you, you don't see that. [waves hand in front of": null, "face] You don't see that, right? It's just here. That's it, right.": null, "Evan copies Whitney\u2019s hand motions.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I appreciate your approach to these things, but if I may, I would": null, "say that you should allow those feelings to happen. You take them and": null, "you examine them like they're a precious piece of glass, and you": null, "internalize what it means to you. Consider that glass and put it down.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Yeah, and then you just smile through it. Just smile through": null, "whatever they're saying. Someone says something ignorant, big smile.": null, "[points to her beautiful smile] Try it.": null, "Evan:\u00a0These feel like three mutually exclusive pieces of advice, all of": null, "which are outside of my wheelhouse.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Great. Great. Well, let's get brooms. I'm sorry.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I'm going to go and I'm gonna say,": null, "Dream:\u00a0Choose the broom that's right for me. Accio, I guess.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I just wanna see, I'm gonna see if I can magically divine which": null, "one is right for me.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, if this is a spell, go ahead and let's make this a Charm": null, "roll. Difficulty of 10. Don't forget your Magic die.": null, "Erika:\u00a012.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Perfect. And you sort of stand there and you wave your wand, and": null, "you get a faint scent of roses under your nose and a slight trill that": null, "sounds like your own voice going on a melodic run. And a tiny spark of": null, "pink light erupts from the end of your wand and begins to travel down": null, "one of the aisles.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.": null, "Sam:\u00a0That's so cool.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0That's dope.": null, "Dream:\u00a0This is a lot less aggressive than I thought it would be, but": null, "it's happening!": null, "Jammer: Yeah, it looks like, pink and stuff.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yeah. It's probably, you know, just warming up.": null, "Jammer: Oh, warming.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Okay, what's it doing?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah, it just goes down the third aisle in a fairly generic,": null, "dusty, dark, old store that's covered with racks and racks of brooms.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yes, yes, this is right.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it leads you towards one. Which broom does it stop at?": null, "You're the one with notes.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Ah, yes. It's a Blocker's Broom.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it alights on the broom, and the whole thing flashes pink": null, "and glittery and sparkles down. And a man peeks around the aisle, his": null, "hair is super poofy, and kind of that sort of dusty brown going to gray,": null, "and he's got big mutton chops that travel around into a mustache. He": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0You could've just walked down the aisle. You don't need to": null, "do a magic about it.": null, "Dream:\u00a0You know, this is still a novelty for me, all right? So please": null, "indulge.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Well, don't point your wand at people like that. Just go": null, "up. Put it down.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Is there wand discipline?": null, "Mutton Chops: Holster it. Yeah!": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Do you see any... Accents, American. [snaps] Oh, you're": null, "them! Got it, got it. Okay. [very slowly] Well, when you're with": null, "wizards.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Okay, we're non-magical, not, you know? I'm trying to think of a": null, "polite way to say it. We're non-magical, not stupid, okay?": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Eh. Sure. You don't see any other wizards walking around": null, "waggling wands in people's faces. That's pretty rude no matter where": null, "you're from, am I right?": null, "Evan:\u00a0Actually, the first adult we met here cast a spell on one of us": null, "within the first three minutes.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Did you deserve it?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Well, I was just saying the M-word a lot.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Why would you do that? What's wrong with you?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0'Cause it felt like it was okay for us to say it as the\uff0d": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Why? You're a wizard. Are you holding a wand? Do you do": null, "magic?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Well, now I do. At the time I did not.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Ever since you got here, you're\uff0d": null, "Jammer:\u00a0A wizard.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Yeah, so you don't get to say that word anymore.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0And now\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0But they don't know to say it because they're not magical and": null, "they have no awareness of this place's existence.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Well, okay, let me just be super clear that this sort of": null, "movement to be a little less terrible about people that aren't like us": null, "is relatively recent, it's new.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0So, we're all kind of getting the mouthfeel for it, as it": null, "were, so please do your part to erase terrible language.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Are we part of a social justice movement?": null, "Sam:\u00a0Oh my god, we totally are.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0You're a bunch of Americans going to a British school for": null, "magic, and none of you were magic before, correct?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Well, we\uff0d": null, "Evan:\u00a0[quickly]\u00a0No, none of us were.": null, "Jammer: I mean, on the field.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Clearly had it latent in us like we were special and chosen.": null, "Sam:\u00a0My manager says I have \"it,\" whatever that means.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Okay. Well, none of that sounded like... You're part of a": null, "movement. Everyone's watching you, so try to not fuck it up. Yeah?": null, "Jammer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Okay, I'd like to say that it's kind of unfair to take some": null, "people from a certain group and then hold them up as examples of all the": null, "entirety of who they are representing, and considering that's": null, "non-magical people, that's a lot of people in the world. Probably\uff0d": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0There's probably hundreds of you out there.": null, "Dream:\u00a0No, it's\uff0d": null, "Evan:\u00a0Sorry, do you not know the population of the world? We're well on": null, "our way to 8 billion people.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0No. [waves hand dismissively]": null, "Dream:\u00a0How many-": null, "Evan:\u00a0You can literally look it up.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0No.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I mean, they don't know what a radio is, so you know.": null, "Evan:\u00a0That's a great point. Where would they look it up?": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0Buy your brooms!": null, "Sam: Okay.": null, "Jammer: Where\u2019s like the\u00a0fast one?": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0This way. Oh, do you play scuppers?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Is that what it's... Scuppers? Is that the sport? That\u2019s some,": null, "oh, man, that don't sound cool at all. Saying I'm a scuppers player does": null, "not sound like it's gonna be cool.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I'm so sorry, that's really rough.": null, "Jammer: That doesn't sound cool, that sounds wizardy.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I got recruited to play scuppers? Dammit. Yeah, I play scuppers.": null, "Mutton Chops:\u00a0All right, I've got you. Come with me.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0He takes you down to a faster, sleeker, technical aisle.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Great.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And after a couple minutes, 'cause I don't wanna stay in this": null, "broom place any longer, you come out with your goddamn brooms.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Why\uff0d": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I just wanna say that I went to the corner of the shop and was": null, "Evan:\u00a0Oh my god, this one looks super affordable.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And got a janitorial push broom that is for the shop.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes. They didn't have the heart to charge you for it, and they": null, "were just like, \"Just, go.\"": null, "Evan:\u00a0This was great, this one was only three copper pieces. They broke": null, "one of my gold coins down and now I have a bunch of silver and a bunch": null, "of copper left.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You actually saw what they did. You handed a gold coin and they": null, "put it on the table and kind of crushed it with their thumb, and it": null, "shattered into a big pile of 18 silver and 19 little copper pieces.": null, "Dream:\u00a0See, all money should be modular, and also tied to something that": null, "actually is substantial and not\uff0d": null, "Evan:\u00a0This is great. I'm gonna have money leftover. I could get clothes,": null, "blanket, get food, get all kinds of stuff. So, hopefully there's a": null, "familiar deal kind of in line with this one 'cause this one's gonna be": null, "great. And also, it has a nice wide seat.": null, "Brennan: And he's looking at the bar and he's like,": null, "Evan: So, that's helpful.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Aside to Sam.": null, "Dream:\u00a0[strained] Sam, he's so tragic.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Keep it together. Keep it together. You're gonna slide all over the": null, "store.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0They don't sell mops here.": null, "Lou: Oh.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Okay, I mean, there surely must've been some mistake in the\u2026 Mine": null, "is bright pink and sparkly, and well, there's nothing wrong with very": null, "femme colors, it's like\u2026 Clearly mine was supposed to be something": null, "awesome and twisted.": null, "Sam:\u00a0And like dark and bloody and stuff?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yeah!": null, "Sam:\u00a0Next time. Maybe you can get that figured out for you.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yeah, there's gotta be some mistake, \u2018cause this...": null, "Erika:\u00a0Has my wand changed at all?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yeah. Actually, [laughs] the tip where that pink erupted stayed": null, "glittery and pink, and hasn't gone back.": null, "Dream:\u00a0[yells] Okay, all right. All right, okay. I can integrate this": null, "into my world view and still be fine. All right.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0It's just not\u2026 I mean, it's definitely cool, it's just not as": null, "twisted as I think I thought. But I don't know, maybe, we don't know,": null, "maybe it'll change again.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Maybe it depends on the kind of spell that you do.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, there it is, yeah.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Maybe pink is like, really metal and goth here, we don't know.": null, "Passerby:\u00a0It's not.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Whoever just walks by.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Sam, what kind of broom did you get?": null, "Sam:\u00a0So, I got the Suave Sweeper, which is a great name. So, it's a dark": null, "broom with the bristles kind of fanned out. Like yeah, suave, you know?": null, "Evan:\u00a0That's great. I think that looks awesome.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Thank you. I'm really excited for it. I hope I don't fall and die.": null, "Dream:\u00a0You'll be fine.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah, that does feel like, I wonder what kind of enchantments the": null, "brooms have on them to ensure that you don't... fall off.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Fall, get hurt and stuff, yeah.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Do we have to take some sort of driving test for these? 'Cause": null, "it's like a mode of transportation, right, that's off the ground, it's": null, "all dimensions, right? So, you have to take a driving test for a car and": null, "that's only just on one plane.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I know in the States, I think in Alaska, you can use a driver's": null, "license for recreational aircraft, like Ultra Lites and stuff like that,": null, "but again, I don't know what the laws would be.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Yo, Tallulah. Do we have to\uff0d": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0Yeah?": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Test or something before we can use these? Or could we just go": null, "to town right off the bat?": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0That's actually a really good question, because normally in": null, "your third year you go through all your flight training, but you're all": null, "penultimate, you're sixth years, so no, I think you're just good to go.": null, "Try not to fall off.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Oh, so it is\u2026 You can fall off.": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0You just gotta hold it.": null, "Sam:\u00a0So, you can fall off and die, oh.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Okay. So, I won't be flying, but that's great.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Following the first little bit of your adventure, I want": null, "everyone to take an Adversity token as just a little gift for doing the": null, "shopping episode. Up top.": null, "Lou:\u00a0There it is.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Just committing to it. It's my favorite. So, you have two of": null, "your three required objects.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Familiars.": null, "Dream:\u00a0This is it. Our lifelong animal companion, tied to us in spirit,": null, "a manifestation of who we are, something that we will not call spirit": null, "animals. And something that is, even Patronuses are kind of on the outs,": null, "so yeah, yeah.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah, for sure. Do you know, Dream, if we have to provide care for": null, "these animals, or they're gonna have food at the-": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh, well, I assume they're just sort of like normal animals,": null, "right? Just that you do have to take care of them.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I mean, between practice and everything I'm not sure I'ma have": null, "time to feed a thing.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Yeah, I worry about\u2026 I worry about being\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0Is it because anything that you nurture and care for is gonna-": null, "[Erika breaks, and Aabria laughs]": null, "Evan:\u00a0Why are you smiling so big when you ask that question?": null, "Dream:\u00a0I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Is it that anything": null, "that you nurture and care for dies a horrible death?": null, "Evan:\u00a0What kind of answer are you looking for in this moment?": null, "Dream:\u00a0One in the affirmative?": null, "Evan: Let's go to the pet shop because I\uff0d": null, "Dream:\u00a0Let's go to the pet shop.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I\uff0d Okay. Yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Evan, go ahead and give me a Brains roll, difficulty of five to": null, "navigate the alley to just get out of this conversation and into the pet": null, "shop.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I lean over to Dream.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0That's like a yes, right? That's like, 100% a yes.": null, "Dream:\u00a0I mean, there's gotta be tons of childhood pets that have, died": null, "under his care and stuff\uff0d": null, "Brennan:\u00a09.": null, "Dream:\u00a0And it's like, I'm sure he doesn't mean it. I'm sure he just": null, "loves them and cares for them and it's just the tragedy of his": null, "existence.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Guys, you're not whispering nearly as soft as you think you are.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Sorry.": null, "Evan:\u00a0[yelling] They don't all die! Sometimes they do stuff, or they": null, "tell me to do stuff. Sometimes they don't turn out to be animals. One": null, "time a pig's head in the butcher shop told me that God and the devil": null, "killed each other.": null, "Evan:\u00a0[still yelling] So you know, I don't know if that's an animal or": null, "not. I don't know if that's an animal or not, and it's been happening": null, "for a long time!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Tallulah is across the alley and just staring at you.": null, "Tallulah: [making a \u201ccut it out\u201d motion] Stop\u00a0it.": null, "Evan:\u00a0[still yelling] I don't know you, so why are you conspiring with": null, "Tallulah:\u00a0[much more quietly] I'm trying\u2026 You are causing a scene.": null, "Evan:\u00a0[loudly] This is more social interaction than I've had in years.": null, "I'm sorry.

You notice that there are certain people that are": null, "looking with that sense of shocked British propriety 'cause your mom": null, "likes watching \"Downton Abbey\", and they're like, \u00a0\"Oh, my god, this is": null, "some \"Downstairs\" bullshit and I don't care for it.\" And there are": null, "others looking, and they seem to be locked in on Evan's frequency and": null, "they are staring at him, unblinking.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think I definitely sense that\u2026 I think just the pig's head story": null, "alone let's me know that Evan's got some intensity to him. And I think": null, "even if Jammer doesn't understand what Evan might be causing with his": null, "abilities, I think Jammer just sees someone in distress and kinda goes": null, "into the mode of, you know when a fight's about to happen on the": null, "basketball court?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yep. Sorry.": null, "Lou:\u00a0And it's like, we cannot\u2026 We are not getting you thrown out of the": null, "game this early.

Yeah, I'll grab you one when you": null, "get to the back.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Okay, so how do familiars work?": null, "Freya:\u00a0Yeah, so you're gonna walk through the area, and essentially, the": null, "animal that's drawn to you will kind of just find you, choose you. It": null, "might not be an animal.

Does that?": null, "Freya:\u00a0Does that make sense?": null, "Dream:\u00a0Amazing. Yes.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0All right. Well, is there just like-": null, "Freya:\u00a0Yeah, you guys can all go the same time.": null, "Aabria: And she kinda opens up the pen and you just get hit with this": null, "burst of hay and animal dook.

I wanna go into this cold.": null, "Freya:\u00a0It's actually kinda warm in there, from the animals.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Oh, no, I mean, it's a, you know, just like-": null, "Freya: Have a great day.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Yeah, cool.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Right. Well. I think Jammer just starts walking up to different": null, "animals and standing in front of them for a second.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0There's a bunch of really cute dogs, and cats, and piles of": null, "toads. And they all kind of wag their tails and acknowledge you if you": null, "make eye contact, but none of them are coming over.": null, "Sam:\u00a0Is that a stream pig? That's a stream pig.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And the moment you say \u00a0\"Stream pig,\" there's this giant sloppy": null, "hog that looks up at you, and then up and over it bounding in a parkour": null, "is just this tiny baby pink piglet.": null, "Dream:\u00a0That is going to do numbers on the 'Gram.": null, "Sam: I know!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It screams at you, like [screaming] and just sprints, it power": null, "slides under the gate and stands on your shoe.

You'll be back, yes you": null, "will.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And it keeps looking back at its back every time you say that.": null, "Dream:\u00a0Wow, that is so perfect for you.": null, "Evan:\u00a0Sam, that pig is adorable.": null, "Sam:\u00a0I know! I gotta get my\u2026 Somebody take some pictures.": null, "Dream:\u00a0All right. Do angles.

You're at like, 12%": null, "now.": null, "[group groaning]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0That's still picture taking, I\u2019m not\u2014": null, "Dream:\u00a0It's enough to get the photos. We'll post them later.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I need you\u2026 I'm gonna call this a Flight roll.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay, we can do a Flight roll.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I'm gonna make the difficulty a 10 for you.": null, "Lou:\u00a0We can make this. Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.": null, "Aabria\u00a0Just something spicy.": null, "Lou:\u00a0That's a two! We're not gonna Adverse\u2026 Oh, that's a two plus two,": null, "equals four. So, that's a failure.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0You need a 10?": null, "Lou:\u00a0I need a 10. Don't give me\u2026 You don't have to give me six. Six?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Well, can I\u2026 Instead of giving him-": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Aabria just gave me a little-": null, "Erika:\u00a0Adversity tokens, Dream is like, \"I got this, I'm fairly sure I": null, "have a handle on this now,\" and magics to find one. It's like, [sighs]": null, "come to me. Yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0What are you\u2026 Casting a spell? Are you helping?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Yeah. Casting a spell to help, yes.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay, hold on. 'Cause what happened in that moment was just sort": null, "of a snap reaction to a thing that was happening. So, as you go to pull": null, "out your phone and you clock that the battery's gone, your basketball": null, "slips out of your duffel bag. [ball bouncing] Just sort of rolls away": null, "and hits the end of one of the little pens.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think I wait a second to see if any of the animals are attracted": null, "to the basketball, knowing that if one of them was, that would be my": null, "animal. Nobody's gonna do it, all right.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And you wait a couple seconds to see, and all the animals kinda": null, "look at it and look at you, and then the basketball slowly begins to": null, "roll back to you.": null, "Erika gasps.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I think I immediately kick it away. [laughing]": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Fight roll, difficulty of five.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay, great. Fight my basketball real quick. That is a our. So, I": null, "think I lose to my basketball. Yeah, I lose to my\u2026 I could never beat my": null, "basketball. I could never-": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You go to kick it, and your basketball jukes out of the way,": null, "almost breaking your own ankles.": null, "Aabria makes a basketball squeaking noise.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I, from the ground,": null, "Jammer:\u00a0Respect. Respect.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And your basketball, while you're on the ground, kind of rolls": null, "back over to you and nudges you in the leg.": null, "Lou:\u00a0I pick it up. I think\u2026 I roll it away again to see if it comes": null, "back.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0It rolls, hits a pen, gets just enough to start dribbling, and": null, "it dribbles back over to you. Does a little figure 8 around your legs.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh, hell yes. I immediately spin.": null, "Aabria\u00a0Yeah!": null, "Jammer:\u00a0I got my familiar.": null, "Evan:\u00a0That's so cool!": null, "Dream:\u00a0That's so perfect for you.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0This is cool. I honestly was really nervous about getting an": null, "animal because I'm also pretty bad with pets, mostly 'cause none of our": null, "pets were real pets, we would just adopt cats that were living around.": null, "It was just-": null, "Dream: They kind of live outside.": null, "Dream:\u00a0They're outdoor cats.": null, "Jammer:\u00a0And you would try to pet them and they'd scratch you, and you'd": null, "be like, well yeah, we didn't do this right. But this, this I know.": null, "Evan:\u00a0I love it. Dude, all the wizards who've been here have been super": null, "mean and snooty and stuff, and this is like, eff them, man. It's like,": null, "you didn't want an animal anyway. This is perfect. I love it. I love": null, "that it's gonna T-O all these jerk wizards, you know?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0I need you to make\u2026 Oh god, what do I want this to be? Grit": null, "roll. Difficulty of 10?": null, "Erika:\u00a0Oh, that's it, I make it. I make it by 12.": null, "Aabria\u00a0Oh, yeah.": null, "Erika:\u00a0Make it by two.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Go off.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0You're good. And as you're watching all of this happen, you": null, "notice you look, and on your shoulder is just a little chipmunk wearing": null, "a very cute sweater with patches on the elbow.

All of you understand.": null, "Erika:\u00a0I look over and there's a giant boa constrictor in the corner and": null, "I kind of try to sidle up to it and be like.": null, "Chipmunk:\u00a0Oh, please don't get closer. It will eat me.": null, "Dream:\u00a0What? No, no, no.": null, "Chipmunk:\u00a0No, it absolutely would.
