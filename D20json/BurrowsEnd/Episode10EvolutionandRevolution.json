And they got farther and farther apart until I fell asleep.": null, "And when I came back, it was a sense of obligation to my family that I": null, "think I have always assumed was duty or obligation.

I'm gonna find": null, "a-": null, "Viola: Could you toss us up there? Just wooh.": null, "Dr. Tara: Yeah, what? Toss you up? I can't throw you 100 feet in the": null, "air. Can you go out through-?": null, "Jaysohn: We don't know what humans can do.": null, "Dr. Tara: Honestly, I appreciate your faith in me.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah I think if I was a human, I could throw us 100 feet in the": null, "air.": null, "Dr. Tara: [Aabria] Probably.": null, "Jaysohn: I'm really strong.": null, "Aabria: And she's gonna get up and open the door that she entered and be": null, "like,": null, "Dr. Tara:\u00a0Please exit, I gotta find a control room.": null, "Ava: This is much easier than stacking one on top of another. Should": null, "keep her around more.": null, "Aabria: And Doctor Steel will handle the threat. So very briefly, before": null, "we end I just want to ask for a little epilogue of what you all do in": null, "the coming hours, days and weeks in Last Bast. There is an immediate": null, "threat still, we'll kind of give a little tier list. What do you do": null, "about the humans? What do you do about Last Bast? And what do you about": null, "your growing family?": null, "Jasper: We should probably try and have a conversation with the leaders": null, "of the humans to inform them of our sentience I guess and explain what": null, "we would like to do. and explain what we would like to do.": null, "Aabria: Going to meet the humans, I need you to make a persuasion check": null, "to convince them that instead of a threat, you are a group deserving of": null, "dignity, respect and the conversations allowed to all humans.": null, "Izzy: Can we use Tara for help?": null, "Aabria: Tara will provide the help action. As she sort of holds you up.": null, "Dr. Tara:\u00a0Ah you're gonna want to listen to this. Hey, hey and don't": null, "worry, you didn't fall down and die. We didn't all die of radiation": null, "poisoning, this is happening.": null, "Thorn: We've been through quite a lot in the last few days. I think": null, "becoming more Stoat or more human, I think becoming more Stoat or more": null, "human, whichever you prefer. And what I have learnt is that there is": null, "nothing And what I have learnt is that there is nothing that you won't": null, "do for those that you love. (pensive music) And from talking to this": null, "wonderful human and seeing you all here, I can't help but think perhaps": null, "you have ones that you love. And maybe that's a commonality that we both": null, "share and if you will allow us, we would like to carry on loving.": null, "Aabria: Please make your persuasion check, with advantage.": null, "Jasper: Okay. Okay, persuasion?": null, "Brennan: Guidance too.": null, "Jasper: Yeah, thank you. Ah, persuasion.": null, "Aabria: And fuck it, Lukas gives you bardic inspiration. (nasally) A D6,": null, "D6.

If humans come again, it will be to treat with you.": null, "But this is your home.": null, "Rashawn: Then I would want to bring more of the nature to this hard": null, "place.

I feel like I understand you a little": null, "bit more. The pressure that I had on Mom releases a little bit more": null, "because I understand.
