This is just a rumor\u2014": null, "Aabria: You could, if you want to.": null, "Brennan: I don't think Hob would start a rumor. I think that this is...": null, "Or not now, not\u2014": null, "Aabria: All right.": null, "Brennan: Not in this position.

If not, then no.": null, "Aabria: All right, noted. Okay, Emily.": null, "Emily: Well, I think Chirp could easily spread a rumor that Theodore has": null, "been so taken with Squak, and Squak let them down so gentlemanly.": null, "[laughs]": null, "Aabria: Oh, okay.": null, "Emily: That Squak was the embodiment of kindness and gentleness, as he": null, "offered Theodore some tea and went to bed early.": null, "Aabria: Amazing.": null, "Lou: That's my cousin.": null, "Oscar: Wow!": null, "Oscar: That's great.": null, "Lou: That's my cousin, right there.": null, "Aabria: Beautiful. Okay, Lou.": null, "Lou: I'd like to turn the rumor of K.P. Hob's defeat of besting of": null, "Andhera into scandal\u2014": null, "Emily: Yes!": null, "Lou: In that Andhera\u2019s inability to show up in the Great Hart Hunt is": null, "just further evidence that it's definitely true, that his combat prowess": null, "is so lacking\u2014": null, "Oscar: Oh, snap\u2014": null, "Lou: That of course, K.P.

All right.": null, "Oscar: I wanna say that the Sea Foam Court is starting this rumor, is": null, "that this Bloom is the last Bloom that will be run this way.": null, "Aabria: So you're scandalizing a previous rumor.": null, "Oscar: I am scandalizing it, yes.": null, "Aabria: So how is it worse than the rumor version of it?": null, "Oscar: So the scandal is that the Bloom will cease to exist after this": null, "Bloom.

He": null, "does not wanna be there, and his helper is making him.": null, "Aabria: Wow!": null, "Surena: So, and it is a rumor that Gwyndolin accidentally spread,": null, "because she was speaking to one of the helpers, like the attendants": null, "helping, and it was just something that she said off the cuff, like akin": null, "to, \"Oh, well, I just didn't think that... I don't think he wants to be": null, "here!\" Just very blunt, but has been construed into a rumor.": null, "[suspenseful music]": null, "Oscar: This is dark-sided right here.": null, "Aabria: It's so good.": null, "Oscar: This is dark-sided!": null, "Emily: It's crazy, 'cause you roll so well on Stealth and Deception that": null, "none of us can start a rumor about you.": null, "[group laughing] [group applauds]": null, "Aabria: And that's how you do it.": null, "Emily: I've been sitting here, being like, \"I just think Gwyndolin is": null, "normal.\" [group laughing] What can I start about Gwyndolin: nothing.": null, "[Surena laughing]": null, "Omar: I heard Gwyndolin had a good time at breakfast.

Different": null, "kinds of battles.": null, "Brennan: Captain Hob nods to them and says,": null, "Captain Hob: As military men, exceptional service under duress never": null, "goes unnoticed or unrewarded.": null, "Brennan performs a series of clapping gestures and then mimics blowing": null, "something out of his hand.": null, "Captain Hob: That was a salute, not a magic trick.": null, "Aabria: And the seahorse valet kinda just does like a weird body roll,": null, "curls their little tail, and spits up a bunch of bubbles in reply.": null, "Captain Hob: The most beautiful salute I've ever seen.": null, "Aabria: And as you're looking up, just turns and moves away.": null, "Brennan: I'll give an order for my soldiers to make sure that when that": null, "material is gathered, to see it invisibly safely escorted back to the": null, "Goblin Pagoda, and I'll make ready for the duel.": null, "Aabria: Copy that. Wuvvy will be waiting for you on this sort of": null, "improvised field of honor with Theodore at her side as her second.": null, "Aabria: [to Lou]\u00a0I have a question for you.": null, "Lou: Yes, of course.": null, "Aabria: Did that really end with just a cuppa tea and a polite": null, "dismissal?": null, "Lou: Not exactly.": null, "Emily: [laughs]\u00a0Why do you think I had to spread it at as a rumor?": null, "Aabria: All right, talk to me.": null, "Aabria: What happened last night?": null, "Lou: Here's the way I see it. The two of us journeyed back toward my": null, "nest, and I turned to Theodore and said,": null, "Squak: Theodore, I must say I am in the works of turning a new beak.": null, "Theodore: Mmm. Everyone has heard you say that.": null, "Squak: Well\u2014": null, "Oscar: It's full on a hashtag at this point.": null, "Lou: Hashtag turning a new beak.": null, "Squak:\u00a0Well, and that's the way I would like it to be, because it is": null, "important for, of course, you and everyone else knows about the grand": null, "wager. So, I actually think you should leave me here this evening and go": null, "on your way.": null, "Theodore: I will leave if you ask.": null, "Theodore: But is that what you are asking? Or are you asking for": null, "discretion?": null, "Squak: [whispering] Oh, Theodore.": null, "[Emily and Lou laughing]": null, "Lou: I think Squak is gonna get down from Theodore's arms. Can I just": null, "make a Perception check? I mean, how much man am I dealing with?": null, "Aabria: Of course!": null, "Lou: Oh, that's a 19.": null, "Aabria: Ooh. Just as like, a quick download on what you're dealing with.": null, "Theodore is known as a champion of the Court of Hoof and Claw. He is not": null, "quite an archfey, though he is by all appearance. Their like, social": null, "strata is just a little different. So this is something closer to the": null, "space that Hob occupies.": null, "Lou: Got it.": null, "Aabria: But instead of it being in battle, it's more just sort of this": null, "exemplar within the society.": null, "Aabria: He is a specimen from this court. And if you were checking for": null, "any amount of sincerity, he is sincere.": null, "Lou: I go...": null, "Squak: I mean, discretion would be essential if I were not turning a new": null, "beak, though... Can you turn into a bird?": null, "Theodore: I can't.": null, "Squak: You can't?": null, "Theodore: I'm sorry.": null, "Squak: Would you allow me to turn you into a bird?": null, "Squak: That's not a sexual thing. That's just a\u2014": null, "Aabria: No, he's taking it the sexual way.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Theodore: How big a bird?": null, "Squak: It's not like that. It's a matter of discretion.": null, "Theodore: Oh, sure.": null, "Squak: I would turn you into a bird. You flit off, send a few birds to": null, "meet you. Those birds come back. No one's the wiser. You transform. We": null, "are discreet. And you and flock of birds disappear yet again. Is that": null, "something you might be interested in?": null, "Theodore: Whatever you want.": null, "Squak: That's what I want.": null, "Lou: And I push two of my fingers to his lips and transform him into a": null, "blue jay.": null, "Aabria: Ooh. He lands on your fingers, like where you were touching his": null, "lips.": null, "Lou: I say,": null, "Squak: Join your friends. They'll show you where to go.": null, "Lou: Throw him up, where another flock of blue jays meet, and they all": null, "go return to the nest, as do I, slowly but surely unbuttoning.": null, "Lou: And we fuck hard. We fuck. I fuck the shit outta Theodore.": null, "Aabria: Understood. And all of that to say, one, it's great.": null, "Lou: It's great.": null, "Aabria: Theodore, dope. He tells you to call him Chooch from now on,": null, "which is a term of endearment, which is great.": null, "Lou: Chooch.": null, "Oscar: You got some chooch.": null, "Aabria: And it is later in the day, when, as he's sort of leaving": null, "discreetly, you actually see Wuvvy walking up to this murmuration of": null, "blue... I learned a thing. Of blue jays. That's probably not the right": null, "thing. It's a flock. It's just a fuckin' flock. [laughs] And Wuvvy": null, "immediately stops and looks up, spotting her friend, even amongst the": null, "birds. And he lands on her shoulder, and she begins to speak in that": null, "sort of \u201call animals\u201d. So she's not chirping. She's just murmuring low.": null, "And they're communicating with each other.": null, "Lou: Is there any part of me that's worried about Wuvvy understanding": null, "what just happened or what has been happening?": null, "Aabria: She came in, in that third feral form, looks very focused on her": null, "own thing.": null, "Lou: Got it. Oh, well then I think I'm just intrigued and wait. I don't": null, "want to interrupt.": null, "Lou: But I will\u2014I mean, I don't speak, I don't think I speak that": null, "language, so. I think I just have to wait until, and just watch.": null, "Aabria: Okay, they have a quick communication, and then she turns off": null, "and walks again. And the bird form of Chooch kind of looks back at you": null, "before\u2014": null, "Lou: Oh, I think I'll dismiss the Polymorph.": null, "Squak: Is something the matter?": null, "Theodore: I'm required to be a second for a duel. If you're interested": null, "in a little afternoon...": null, "Squak: Oh, I'm very interested.": null, "Lou: And I would love to send out birds to as many houses as possible.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, there we go.": null, "Lou: A duel on the Southern Lawn. Do I know who the... I know there is a": null, "duel. Does Chooch tell me who between?": null, "Aabria: Absolutely.": null, "Lou: Oh, a duel between Captain Hob, and I'd like to present it as Rue's": null, "assistant.": null, "All:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "Brennan: Names in mouths.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Incredible.": null, "Lou: Birds flitting all about to all the different courts.": null, "Aabria: Incredible. This reaches all of you in short order, and it is at": null, "your discretion whether or not you attend the duel.": null, "Emily: This is someone else's mistakes. I'm absolutely going to": null, "spectate.": null, "Emily: I bring a big pot of tea.": null, "Aabria: Yes, you do.": null, "[Omar and Oscar laughing]": null, "Aabria: That's teamwork.": null, "Brennan: Makes the dream work.": null, "Aabria: Yep. As you sip that tea, it tastes like tea, but you feel": null, "great, is the thing.": null, "Chirp: Cousin.": null, "Chirp: They've brewed a spectacular tea today.": null, "Squak: Well, then pour me a damn glass.": null, "Aabria: Messy homie. [to Omar] Andhera.": null, "Omar: When the bird lands on the sill, I want to have just initiated a": null, "conversation with Advisor. Can I have spoken to someone, the Court of": null, "Sea Foam, to see if there is a library somewhere?": null, "Aabria: Oh, yeah, absolutely. And there absolutely is.": null, "[gentle music]": null, "Andhera: Actually, I spoke to some of the folks who are running the": null, "entire event, and it turns out that...": null, "Advisor: The Court of Sea Foam?": null, "Andhera: Yes.": null, "Advisor: Okay, you can just... Okay.": null, "Andhera: Oh.": null, "Advisor: You're good.": null, "Andhera: I spoke to the Court of Sea Foam [laughs] and there happens to": null, "be a dank dark sea cave filled with books. If you might be interested in": null, "spending some time there, it's not one of our caves, but it is a cave.": null, "Aabria: Hmm. Make a Persuasion check with advantage.": null, "Omar: Okay, let's see. Okay. Persuasion. That's gonna be a total of 17.": null, "Aabria: And he smirks for the first time that you've seen in years.": null, "Advisor: You're not tryin' to get rid of me, are you?": null, "Andhera: No, I would actually be in a lot of trouble if I did. It's just": null, "genuinely\u2014I don't know, as I'm interacting with more people, I'm": null, "realizing how I treat people. And I want to treat you as well as": null, "possible, because for the longest time you were my only friend.": null, "Aabria: And he gives you a deep bow.": null, "Andhera: You don't have to do that to me. No, no, no, no, no, stop. Or": null, "I'll bow to you.": null, "Advisor: No, don't\u2014": null, "Andhera:\u00a0I\u2019ll bow to you\u2014": null, "Advisor:\u00a0Don't do it back.": null, "Andhera: Okay.": null, "Advisor: This is good. You are good.": null, "Omar: When that happens, a little cloud forms over Andhera's head, and": null, "it just rains just a tiny bit, and they quickly reach behind their neck": null, "and the cloud dissipates.": null, "Andhera: Thank you. Thank you.": null, "Omar: And then the bird appears, delivers the news.": null, "Advisor: Oh. Well, I'm definitely not going to that, 'cause it's like": null, "noon.": null, "Andhera: Yes, that's gonna be quite hot, and I know that it might cause": null, "me some damage. Although I could find like a large piece of paper to": null, "hold over my head, but\u2026 Let me run this by\u2014": null, "Oscar: [laughing] A piece of paper.": null, "Chirp: What is Pillar Boy wearing?": null, "Squak: Seems to be a large piece of paper.": null, "Aabria: Hats do exist.": null, "Omar: I mean, what if we never had those? I would have no hats.": null, "Aabria: You would know.": null, "Omar: Why would we have hats in the caves?": null, "Aabria: Because of bat droppings.": null, "Omar: You'd think so, but\u2014 [laughs]": null, "Aabria: But no.": null, "Andhera: Advisor, can I run this by you really quickly?": null, "Advisor: Mmm.": null, "Andhera: It's unbecoming and uncouth to interfere with a duel, but": null, "everyone is talking about how I was bested by Hob. Would it not be more": null, "important\u2014": null, "[group laughing and clapping]": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yes.": null, "Andhera: For me to take this as an opportunity to prove my worth?": null, "Lou: Yes, triple duel.": null, "Oscar: What?": null, "Lou: A triple duel!": null, "Emily: Yes, yes, yes!": null, "Advisor: A bold suggestion, young master.": null, "Andhera: Well, I'm a bold boy. [laughs]": null, "Advisor: You're only saying that around me, right? You don't say that": null, "around other people?": null, "Andhera: I have never said that I'm a bold boy around anybody.": null, "Advisor: Huh. I would never presume to tell you how to comport yourself": null, "in this specific instance. All other times, absolutely.": null, "Advisor: Do what you think is best.": null, "Oscar: Oh my god. Shit's about to go down.": null, "Emily: Oh my god.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0I can't, I can't\u2014": null, "Surena:\u00a0I caaaan't\u2014": null, "Advisor: This is possibly the last Bloom.": null, "Andhera: Well then, it's time to go prove myself.": null, "Omar:\u00a0And I go to grab my double-bladed scimitar, and I reach at the": null, "exact wrong place and kinda cut myself a little bit.": null, "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andhera:\u00a0Shit!": null, "Advisor: Oh my god, he's gonna die.": null, "Andhera: Here we go!": null, "Omar:\u00a0And I sheath\u2014": null, "Advisor: I'm gonna go find a book about bringing people back from the": null, "dead.": null, "Advisor: Okay. Be careful.": null, "Andhera: Oh, I always am.": null, "[Advisor groans]": null, "Aabria: And he just disappears in a cloud of concern.": null, "Andhera: I mean, I was born\u2014shit, where\u2019d you go, I had\u2014": null, "Aabria: Gwyn?": null, "Surena:\u00a0Yes?": null, "Aabria: Do you go to the duel?": null, "Surena: I do. In hearing about the duel, I'm in my quarters, the bird": null, "flies away and I'm by myself in my room. I am constructing a large": null, "umbrella. I'm fully in my comfortable self. So my moth wings are kinda": null, "rustling against my very crowded room, 'cause my room has lots of things": null, "in it. And I'm looking for sticks and big leaves and just whatever I had": null, "kind of gathered to make a large umbrella. I take the shell that you": null, "gave me, and I kind of jam it into almost like a large needle with": null, "thread, and I sort of twine it into a bracelet. And then I'm just making": null, "sure I have everything.": null, "[inquisitive instrumental music]": null, "Surena:\u00a0And then I go,": null, "BINX: Oh, oh gosh, okay.": null, "Surena: And I grab my magnifying glass, and I look up, and I go,": null, "BINX: Paging Mika. Mika, Mika, hi. Mika, hi. Hello.": null, "Mika: Oh my God, there you are. Where have you been? What's going on?": null, "BINX: Don't you remember? I told you that I was doing like, a thing, and": null, "that you needed to leave me alone for like a hot second.": null, "Mika: I have done my best to leave you alone. Is this enough time? Are": null, "you available?": null, "BINX: I'm available right now.": null, "Mika: Okay.": null, "BINX: Okay. What\u2014what's happening, are you okay? Are you in danger, are": null, "you hurt?": null, "Mika: I need more spell slots.": null, "BINX: Okay, oh boy, all right.": null, "Mika: I can do like two cool things, and then I have to go to bed.": null, "BINX: Right, right.": null, "BINX:\u00a0No, I can't fix that exactly.": null, "Mika: Why not?": null, "BINX: No, no, but I can give you other things that you can switch out.": null, "So how about this? What was your last problem? You needed\u2014": null, "Mika: My son keeps hurting himself.": null, "BINX: Right, right, right.": null, "Mika: At squire practice.": null, "BINX: So I feel like\u2014": null, "BINX: I feel like you need a babysitter. Right?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I know that's not what it's called.": null, "BINX: Okay?": null, "Brennan:\u00a0That's not what it's called.": null, "BINX: So, what I'm gonna do for you, alright, I need you to get a couple": null, "items. Can you do that?": null, "Mika: Are you sending me on a fetch quest?": null, "BINX: Well, I mean, you might have 'em on you.": null, "Mika: It's taken me weeks to fetch you.": null, "BINX: Well, listen\u2014": null, "BINX: Listen, all right, I need you to grab some wood and string.": null, "Mika: Just like, any wood?": null, "BINX: I mean, it should be like special wood, but like, any string is": null, "fine.": null, "Mika: What the fuck is special... I'm so sorry, what is special wood?": null, "BINX: Like wood from like a freshly fallen tree, or wood that you've": null, "said \u201cThank you, wood\u2014\u201d": null, "Mika: Okay, okay, okay.": null, "BINX: \u201cFor being you.\u201d You know what I mean?": null, "Mika: We out here thankin' stumps and stuff?": null, "BINX: You should be.": null, "Mika: Okay, okay, you know what, no. I'm actively listening. Go on,": null, "special wood, string of\u2014": null, "BINX: Any kind.": null, "Mika: Any string, okay.": null, "BINX: Any string. Plainer the better, honestly.": null, "Mika: Does twine work? I have twine in my kitchen.": null, "BINX: Nope, has to be string. Specifically string only.": null, "Mika: Okay, secondary question, what's the difference between string and": null, "thread?": null, "BINX: So string is\u2014": null, "Mika: Because I've been getting into embroidery.": null, "BINX: Oh, yeah, yeah. So embroidery thread is different than string.": null, "String is like to stitch your clothes. It's the thickness.": null, "Mika: But I put embroidery thread in my clothes?": null, "BINX: Yeah, but it's\u2014": null, "Mika: Okay, I understand. I'll find string, continue.": null, "BINX: All right, I'm sorry. No, no, no, all right. And then I need you": null, "to tie the string upon the\u2014": null, "Mika: Hold on.": null, "BINX:\u00a0What?": null, "Mika:\u00a0[shouting] Jeff! Get down. Get down. Get down.": null, "BINX: Oh, it's\u2014": null, "Mika:\u00a0Down.": null, "Oscar: Jeff. [laughs]": null, "Emily: Is Jeff her child or a dog?": null, "Mika: Okay, I'm sorry, what\u2014where were we?": null, "BINX: No, no, it's fine. You have the wood and string?": null, "Mika: Oh, I'll grab it in a sec. Do I need to get it right now? Is this": null, "like, a thing?": null, "BINX: I mean\u2014well, I was gonna walk you through it, but like, you just": null, "remember it. Just remember it, okay?": null, "Mika: I'm just a little busy right now. You called me, it's\u2014": null, "BINX: I did. I did call you.": null, "Mika: Yeah.": null, "BINX: Yeah, so touch\u00e9.": null, "Mika: Look, I'll put it\u2014I'll go get it now.": null, "BINX: Okay, okay. I need you to repeat after me when you do the thing,": null, "okay?": null, "Aabria: She has left the call, and you can hear her walking around the": null, "house.": null, "Surena: And it's like when you put your phone down, and it's like\u2014": null, "Aabria: Yeah, 100%. You hear her yelling at a small child.": null, "Surena: Perfect, and I'm just like\u2014the view I have is of her kitchen": null, "table or whatever she's at. Perfect.": null, "Aabria: Yes, 100%. And she comes back like two minutes later.": null, "Mika: Okay, I found wood. I thanked it.": null, "BINX: Yes, good, that's very important.": null, "Mika: And then I pulled string out of my clothes. That's string, right?": null, "BINX: Yes.": null, "Mika: Like fabric string is string?": null, "BINX: String, string, yes.": null, "Mika: Copy, okay. What do you need?": null, "BINX: I need you to say \u201cfiddly dee.\u201d": null, "Mika: Is that the whole thing?": null, "BINX: No, no, no, just\u2014": null, "Mika: One at a time?": null, "BINX: Yeah, yeah.": null, "Mika: Fiddly dee.": null, "BINX: \u201cFiddly bean.\u201d": null, "Mika: Fiddly bean.": null, "BINX: \u201cRequesting help from a friend unseen.\u201d": null, "Mika: Requesting help from a friend unseen.": null, "BINX: You can now cast Unseen Servant.": null, "Mika: Thank you. How does that work? How long does that last?": null, "BINX: For a bit. You'll figure it out. It'll dissipate. It's not for a": null, "long time, but for some time.": null, "Mika: Do I get that as a ritual? Or do I have to burn another fuckin'": null, "spell slot that I don't have on this?": null, "BINX: You know like the spells you can cast all the time? Like willy": null, "nilly?": null, "Mika: Yeah, like a cantrip.": null, "BINX: Right.": null, "Oscar: This is good for me.": null, "Mika: Yes.": null, "BINX: Now you have an extra spell slot that has a spell in it and that's": null, "not cantrip.": null, "Mika: Wait, so this is a spell slot that's already being taken by this": null, "spell specifically, and I don't know how good it is? That's so nice of": null, "you.": null, "BINX: Yeah, I mean like, you have to figure it out.": null, "Mika: Thank you, I have to go.": null, "BINX: Okay, bye.": null, "Mika: Bye.": null, "Brennan: Is BINX a warlock patron?": null, "Brennan: Oh my God, we got an answer!": null, "Aabria: It's crazy that you answered. I was like, \u201cthere's no way she's": null, "gonna tell, oh, she's\u2014\u201d": null, "Brennan: I'm like over here like, \u201cnot enough spell slots. Oh, wait a": null, "minute, this is a warlock!\u201d": null, "Omar: Wait.": null, "Surena: Shh.": null, "Aabria: Did you say \u201cshh?\u201d": null, "Surena: Yeah.": null, "Aabria: Inspiration, that's great.": null, "Oscar: Inspiration.": null, "Aabria: That's great, that's great.": null, "Omar: Wait, what was I doing?": null, "Surena: She sets it down. BINX thinks it went really well.": null, "Surena: Is as well as\u2014": null, "Aabria: That's a good interaction. Mika is a perennially stressed": null, "dwarven mother.": null, "Surena: So much anxiety.": null, "Surena: And as she puts it down, takes a deep breath, and as she stands": null, "up straight, she now Gwyndolinifies and takes the umbrella and walks out": null, "the door.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. And finally, my question before I ask Rue what they are": null, "doing is\u2014did Squak send a bird to Rue to inform them of the duel?": null, "Lou: Yes.": null, "Brennan: \u201cRue's assistant\u201d to Rue, oh.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Uh-huh. So before that moment shows up, Rue is getting ready for": null, "the new event.": null, "Brennan: [whispering to Emily]\u00a0I'm gonna get an outfit.": null, "Emily: Yeah, I know, I know.": null, "[elegant piano music]": null, "Oscar: They're wearing sort of their evening outfit, which is just a": null, "sort of like, beautiful, delicate nightgown made out of gossamer. And it": null, "shimmers a rainbow hue without any sort of light source at all. It just": null, "sort of happens. As they walk down with their nightgown, you can hear a": null, "soft harp playing. It's the sound that the fabric makes against them.": null, "Aabria: Oh my god.": null, "Surena: So beautiful.": null, "Oscar: So they're in their nightgown, and they're deciding what to wear.": null, "And then I guess they receive the message.": null, "Lou: Tap, tap, tap on your window.": null, "Oscar: From the bird. I take in that message. And I close my eyes, and": null, "they stay shut for a long time. Tears fall down my face, and it's a mix": null, "of fear, absolute fear, and anger. I open them, I look at my wardrobe,": null, "and then I come out. I do go to the duel.": null, "Aabria: Of course you do.": null, "Oscar: But, I am wearing a mock snakeskin unitard.": null, "[regal music]": null, "Lou: Who's gonna be watching the duel?": null, "Oscar: I'm wearing combat boots.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Made out of mock fish scales.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooh.": null, "Oscar: I'm wearing gloves made out of mock cowhide. And most notably of": null, "all, I'm wearing a oversized coat, sort of like a oversized military": null, "coat, but it is made out of giant porcupine quills.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. So approachable.": null, "Oscar: They're sort of like\u2014yeah, yeah, yeah.": null, "Aabria: Why are they single?": null, "Oscar: Like, yeah, flaccid porcupine quills that sort of just like move": null, "when they walk around. They're also wearing a helmet with porcupine": null, "quills sort of creating this mohawk effect. So it, essentially, it is": null, "sort of like a high fashion Vogue X Akira collab\u2014": null, "Oscar: Made by\u2014": null, "Oscar: Made by the Animal Kingdom sort of in support of Wuvvy, and": null, "that's sort of their intention of appearing at the duel.": null, "Aabria: And so you all... Yeah, beautiful.": null, "Aabria: What do we... Intimidation. Advantage on Intimidation for the": null, "rest of the session.": null, "[players gasping]": null, "All: Oooh.": null, "Brennan: Amazing.": null, "Aabria: You all arrive at your time, on your schedule, on the dueling": null, "ground.": null, "The dome changes from green to red.": null, "[gentle intense music]": null, "Aabria: When you walk up, Hob, you and your second, you see that": null, "Theodore and Wuvvy are already standing there. She looks right standing": null, "next to him in that third form, the feral form. He has also taken it in": null, "support of her. Normally you all have seen Wuvvy in just sort of breezy,": null, "open blouses, in a color that is complementary to, but never matching,": null, "Rue. But here she is in this incredibly intricate platinum gilt armor": null, "with pure white tabard underneath, and you can see her physicality": null, "through it. And she has a long sword under her hand, and she waits still": null, "and silent, and just stares at you as you walk up.": null, "Brennan: This being at noon, I trust that the Lord Blemish and Lady": null, "Boil, are they present for this? Or they are still at the Goblin Pagoda?": null, "Lou: They got a bird.": null, "Aabria: [pointing across the room]\u00a0There they are.": null, "Brennan: Then on my way in, I look at Wuvvy and Theodore, regard them as": null, "a tiny little goblin drags my halberd through the grass behind me.": null, "Aabria: It takes so long.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to turn from Wuvvy and Theodore to Lord and Lady": null, "Blemish. Only if I was of the utmost certainty that I would be unheard": null, "if I whispered something to them, would I do it. But are we surrounded": null, "by goblins right now? Or are we out in public?": null, "Aabria: It is in public, but they\u2014as you approach, they like pretty": null, "immediately come over to you.": null, "Brennan: Is Gwyndolin here? Or is BINX here?": null, "Brennan: Gotcha.": null, "Aabria: Who?": null, "Brennan: I'm just going to lean in and say,": null, "Captain Hob: My lord and lady, I have attempted to atone for my mistakes": null, "of the first day of the Bloom. You will find me not lacking in propriety": null, "or vigilance. Keep your eyes trained on young Gwyndolin of the Court of": null, "Wonder. She is not who she seems.": null, "Aabria: They spit at the ground at your feet and grin viciously.": null, "Captain Hob: [slurping] You honor me.": null, "Brennan: And I will turn to face Wuvvy and Theodore, and I look and see": null, "Rue dressed as they are in support of Wuvvy, and, at an 8 on my": null, "Deception check, to hide how truly hurt I am.": null, "Aabria: Oh my god, make an Insight check.": null, "Oscar: Okay.": null, "Aabria: Roll higher than an 8, please.": null, "Oscar: So, I'm seeing this, yes? I'm seeing\u2014": null, "Brennan: Yeah.": null, "Oscar: 'Cause are we making eye contact?": null, "Brennan: Yeah, I think we lock eyes and I see how you are dressed.": null, "Oscar: Okay, 13.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, clocked.": null, "Oscar: Clocked.": null, "Brennan: I make eye contact with you and make that face, that sort of": null, "screwed up sour face you make, as you swallow a difficult emotion and": null, "walk towards the dueling field.": null, "Oscar: You see my lips tremble and me lose focus for a second, eyes": null, "watering, as I make a very obvious gesture that I am turning, breaking": null, "eye contact from you, and turning to Wuvvy.": null, "Aabria: For what it's worth, and this is not disrespect, and you know": null, "that, because you and Wuvvy have had so many conversations, especially": null, "when she moved from her home court to the Court of Wonder, you were one": null, "of the few people that knew that in her time before she was so enamored": null, "with you, that she forewent her place in her court as a champion to join": null, "you, that the fact that she won't turn to face you is not a thing of": null, "disrespect.": null, "Oscar: Yeah. And I get that.": null, "Aabria: It's a guard position. She's in her post herself between you.": null, "Oscar: I'm matching Wuvvy's energy at this moment. And assuming there's": null, "like a hill somewhere, and I strategically place myself at the top of": null, "the hill.": null, "Aabria: Of course, of course.": null, "Oscar: To be seen by all.": null, "Aabria: Of course. There's also like one beautiful tree overhead. We": null, "have to have the moment.": null, "Oscar: And the lighting is just right.": null, "Aabria: Of course it is.\u00a0It's noon, it's beautiful.": null, "Aabria: And yeah, Wuvvy, who, I think you would notice\u2014that big": null, "difference between the way you see her before and the way you see her": null, "now is her eyes that were so big and kind of wide-set have gone from a": null, "prey animal's eyes to a predator's eyes, and she does not blink as she": null, "watches you approach.": null, "Brennan: I think it becomes clear to everyone this is a moment where Hob": null, "seems dissimilar from other goblins in a big way. He doesn't lick his": null, "lips. He doesn't bare his fangs. He's also not a gladiator or an": null, "adventurer. There's no bravado here. He walks up rigidly, waits for his": null, "second to provide the weapon, and regards Wuvvy\u2014": null, "Gorebladder: [panting] You got this.": null, "Captain Hob: Gorebladder, well done.": null, "Gorebladder: Wait, if you die, do I have to fight? Oh, fuck.": null, "Captain Hob: Yes, if I die, you're gonna step in, you're gonna grab the": null, "halberd, all right?": null, "Gorebladder: Yeah, okay.": null, "Captain Hob: Figure it out.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to turn to Wuvvy, flip the halberd around, and": null, "bow as deeply as I can and stand up.": null, "Aabria: She like, sweeps a leg out in a very practiced return bow.": null, "Everyone that watches has a very strong sense that this is not her first": null, "duel. Where's Andhera in this moment?": null, "Omar: Not there right now, or not being seen quite yet.": null, "Aabria: Okay. You're all of sufficient station to know how a duel works.": null, "The most important rule as observers is that if you are to offer a boon": null, "to a combatant, you must do it before the duel begins. Any magic that is": null, "cast by a non-participant during the duel would have disastrous": null, "repercussions on your standing within society.": null, "Emily: And the only participants we know are the two.": null, "Emily: Okay.": null, "Lou: I believe in this moment, Squak is going to kind of, still being": null, "amongst the crowd, but aloud, and so that Hob can hear it, shout,": null, "Squak: There he stands, proud and true, the hero of Briar Falls!": null, "Lou: And I'm gonna give you a Bardic Inspiration.": null, "Brennan: Hob turns to you and looks, and I think it has actually escaped": null, "Hob that the Lords of the Wing are mad about the shit he said. I think": null, "he meant it in so little offense, and it has not gotten back to him that": null, "that was a faux pas, so I think he looks at you and goes,": null, "Brennan salutes and makes a bird with his hands.": null, "Squak: What do you think he's\u2014": null, "Chirp: Cousin, Cousin, what's your play? What's your play? And should I": null, "join this?": null, "Squak: I just\u2014there's something about the Court of Wonder looking a fool": null, "that just feels right on this day.": null, "Chirp: And you think that Hob winning would make the Court of Wonder": null, "look a fool?": null, "Squak: I mean, it would be a besmirch of Rue and the company they keep.": null, "So...": null, "Chirp: Oh, but I do so dearly love Rue.": null, "Squak: Oh, as do I, but, I mean...": null, "Chirp: Perhaps we should divide.": null, "Squak: Oh.": null, "Emily: And I'll walk over and I'll stand with Rue.": null, "Oscar: Oh wait, this is unprecedented.": null, "[Aabria laughs] [group laughing]": null, "Lou: I look over at her with them, and I nod.": null, "Chirp: Rue, would you like some tea?": null, "Rue: Oh.": null, "Oscar: Oh, no.": null, "Rue: Featherfowl.": null, "Chirp: Mmm.": null, "Rue: Sorry, I'm caught in a moment here. What is it that you ask of me?": null, "Chirp: I'm so sorry. I was offering you tea.": null, "Rue: This is hardly the time for tea. I'm sorry, I must turn it down.": null, "[Brennan gasps]": null, "Chirp: Oh, 'kay.": null, "[Brennan laughs]": null, "Rue: I'm sorry, do you not see the battle that's about to take place? I": null, "don't think it's time for tea. This is not tea time business at this": null, "moment.": null, "Chirp: So refreshments during dueling is apparently unprecedented. Okay.": null, "Rue: Well, maybe for the Lord of the Wings, but not here. Not for me.": null, "Not when this is happening.": null, "Chirp: Well\u2014": null, "Aabria: Wuvvy picks up her broadsword. At her full height, this would be": null, "like a two-hander. She wields it with one arm and holds it at a point.": null, "Wuvvy: Are you ready to begin?": null, "Captain Hob: That I am. Are you?": null, "Wuvvy: Yes.": null, "Brennan: And Hob will wait until whoever, whichever of our seconds fires": null, "off a shot or makes some noise and then we'll begin.": null, "Oscar: Wait, may I do something before it starts?": null, "Aabria: Please do, yeah.": null, "Rue: Pardon me, lady.": null, "Chirp: Oh, I really didn't mean offense. I'm just gonna go back to my": null, "cousin.": null, "Chirp: Yeah, bye.": null, "Oscar: Thank you. I walk down from the hill and walk straight up to you,": null, "and say to you,": null, "Rue: Have you thought this through? Is this what you really wanna do?": null, "Aabria: And for just a moment, her expression softens, and her pupils go": null, "a little wide, and then they narrow back to points.": null, "Wuvvy: Yes. You wouldn't have done what you thought you needed to do to": null, "me to force my compliance if it weren't for him.": null, "Rue: [softly] Take care.": null, "Oscar: And I touch your shoulder, and I give you Bear's Endurance.": null, "Aabria: What? What's that?": null, "Oscar: You have an advantage on Constitution checks. Is that even worth": null, "it in a battle? I don't know.": null, "Aabria: We'll find out.": null, "Oscar: It also gains two d6 temporary hit points, which are awesome.": null, "Brennan: Now that's quite useful in a battle.": null, "Aabria: Roll 2d6 for me.": null, "Brennan: Hob sees this and the vibe changes.": null, "Oscar: 7. 7.": null, "Aabria: 7\u00a0total?": null, "Aabria: Look, I'm not one to brag, but I will say that she's up to 95": null, "hit points now.": null, "Brennan: Copy that.": null, "Aabria: Mmhmm.": null, "Oscar: After that, I just walk back.": null, "Aabria: Yep. And she turns and faces you. And the way this kind of goes": null, "is a neutral party, a beautiful woman with azure skin and scatterings of": null, "iridescent green scales and a pale mint green gossamer gown, walks": null, "forward, a baroness of the Sea Foam Court, walks out with a ribbon. [to": null, "Lou] Yeah, that was a good look. You recognize her. And she'll drop a": null, "ribbon to initiate the duel. So here's what we do. We're both gonna roll": null, "initiative. Whoever wins on initiative gets the first strike.": null, "Aabria: The second person makes their attack roll with disadvantage, and": null, "then we just go round by round until someone yields.": null, "Brennan: How big is the space that we are in?": null, "Aabria: This is like a long lane that is 50 feet wide and 70 feet long.": null, "Brennan: If we got a lot of space, Hob's looking happy about that.": null, "Brennan: Cool, I'll roll initiative.": null, "Aabria: All right. Let me roll first to tell you what you need to beat.": null, "You need to beat a 14.": null, "[dramatic tense music]": null, "Brennan: I got a 14.": null, "Lou:\u00a0Oh.": null, "[Emily gasps]": null, "Aabria: I'll give it to you, meets it beats it.": null, "Aabria: So make your attack roll.": null, "Brennan: Let's roll up here.": null, "Lou: You underneath that tree.": null, "Oscar: I don't like this. [laughs]": null, "Aabria: They rush towards each other.": null, "Brennan: Bonus action rage.": null, "Brennan: And it's not a howling frenzied rage. It is a deep-set": null, "[growling and yelling] and rushes forward. First attack is going to be": null, "23 to hit.": null, "Aabria: Hits.": null, "Brennan: This is going to be a trip attack. Also, I'm rocking a 15-foot": null, "reach right now.": null, "Aabria: That's right, okay.": null, "Brennan: So it's like\u2014": null, "Brennan: My one arm is like six and a half feet of reach. And as I run": null, "up two-handed, I drop, let the pole slide so the full extension of the": null, "halberd comes in. This is going to be a trip attack.": null, "Brennan: So we'll go in. That's gonna be Strength saving throw of DC 15,": null, "on a failure they are knocked prone.": null, "Aabria: 16.": null, "Brennan: Okay, damage for this is just gonna be 7 plus 4, 11 points of": null, "damage.": null, "Brennan: [to Omar]\u00a0You want this smoke? And I'm going to\u2014": null, "Brennan: I'll go ahead and attack again.": null, "Brennan: 3\u00a0plus 7 is 10. I think that's\u2014I think I'm just gonna let that": null, "be a miss, but I will action surge and attack twice more.": null, "Brennan: That's gonna be 15, and I'll actually go ahead and use the": null, "Bardic Inspiration here. It's gonna be 22 to hit.": null, "Brennan: Another trip attack.": null, "Aabria: Okay.\u00a0Natural 17.": null, "Brennan: Okay. 8 and 3 plus six, it's 14. Another 17 points of damage.": null, "This is my last of four attacks right here. That's gonna be 17 to hit.": null, "Aabria: Misses.": null, "Brennan: 17 misses, copy that, cool. And then I'll stay at a 15 foot": null, "remove.": null, "Aabria: Okay. I will make my attacks, and I'll make mine with": null, "disadvantage 'cause you got the drop, but she does point at you as she": null, "was rushing forward, says something under her breath, and you see just a": null, "tiny tendril of white smoke move from her pupil, and all of you see that": null, "it moves across yours, too. She's marked you.": null, "Aabria: [muttering while rolling dice]\u00a0That would have been great.": null, "Lou: You doin' okay, Rue?": null, "Oscar: Yes.": null, "Aabria: With the\u2014": null, "Emily: Rue, I was just tryin' to stand next to so you had someone to": null, "talk to.": null, "Aabria: 21 to hit.": null, "Brennan: 21 hits.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Jesus Christ. You're going to take 16 points of piercing": null, "damage, as she slides across you, and I need you to make a Constitution": null, "saving throw.": null, "Brennan: Is that 16 halved because I'm raging?": null, "Aabria: Oh no, I didn't halve it, I didn't halve it.": null, "Brennan: And then a Constitution saving throw, correct?": null, "Brennan: That's gonna be 23.": null, "Aabria: Damn, yeah, you're fine. You feel at the point where her blade": null, "slices you, but doesn't really cut deeply, it stings more than it": null, "should. You've taken a lot of blade hits before, and you know there is": null, "something funky to her blade. That's first attack. Second one would be a": null, "17 to hit.": null, "Brennan: 17 hits.": null, "Aabria: Oh, okay, sweet. Take another, and I'm not halving these, 23": null, "points, and you can halve it to 11 and one more con save.": null, "Brennan: You got it. And she's making these with disadvantage, right?": null, "Brennan: Oof.\u00a0Okay, that's gonna be 17.": null, "Aabria: Okay, you still beat it. And you feel that same thing again. And": null, "I'll even say on this one, like, as she hits you and catches you at the": null, "very end, even as she passes you, you notice just a little film, an oil": null, "slick of color on her blade. You finish separate from each other. She is": null, "looking much worse for wear, comparatively, but she turns and makes no": null, "posture of any sort of resignation or yielding, and staggering even a": null, "little bit, raises her blade for another round.": null, "Omar: Just then, four torch-size\u2014": null, "[Emily cheering] [Surena cheering]": null, "Omar: Dancing lights appear between the two of you.": null, "Omar: A little hard to see in the afternoon.": null, "Aabria: [laughing] It's noon.": null, "Omar: They are as if you were looking at a gemstone, but without the": null, "casing on the outside, and they kind of move, and then they move a": null, "little bit more frantically to get attention at the best of their": null, "ability, and from 120 feet away you hear,": null, "Andhera: I demand satisfaction.": null, "[Lou banging]": null, "Oscar: Oh, like\u2014": null, "Andhera: I demand\u2014": null, "Chirp: Squak, what now?": null, "Oscar: Yeah, everyone turns to Squak.": null, "Squak: I'm sorry. This is not on me. I don't believe.": null, "Andhera: I demand... Can you hear me? Can I... There's nothing I can": null, "cast to make my voice...": null, "Omar: As I'm closing in\u2014": null, "Omar: The 120 foot distance, holding a piece of paper over my head.": null, "Aabria: And Wuvvy's stance immediately changes. She respects the form of": null, "this. And even in her ferocity will observe the form, and she goes back": null, "into a neutral pose.": null, "Omar: And I drop the paper\u2014": null, "Wuvvy: From whom?": null, "Andhera: Not from you.": null, "Wuvvy: Mmm.": null, "Andhera: Hob, you bested me in battle once.": null, "Oscar: Lord.": null, "Andhera: You bested me in battle just once.": null, "Omar: And I wanna drop the robe that I have, and so I'm just in like": null, "cotton pants.": null, "Surena: What?": null, "Oscar: [laughing] What?": null, "Surena:\u00a0What? What?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Yes-suh!": null, "Omar: And on the back of my neck is an elemental shard. It's blue and it": null, "glows a bit as\u2014like, my skin is sizzling a bit, but a dark rain cloud": null, "[thunder clapping] forms over my head and starts to thunder as I storm": null, "onto the battlefield itself with my double-bladed scimitar in hand.": null, "Oscar: So, you're wearing cotton pants, and it's raining on you. You're": null, "soaking wet.": null, "Lou: And you're shirtless.": null, "Surena: Your shirt is off.": null, "Oscar: Shirt is off.": null, "Omar: Yes.": null, "Oscar:\u00a0That\u2014": null, "Surena: Cool.": null, "Oscar: That would cling, the rain will make the pants cling, so we see": null, "it all.": null, "[Lou and Omar laughing]": null, "Emily: What are the rules for casting a spell now?": null, "Aabria: In this moment, Wuvvy turns and faces you.": null, "Wuvvy: This has nothing to do with our disagreement.": null, "Captain Hob: No, in fact, I would say the Prince of the Unseelie Court": null, "has just... I don't know what the Prince of the Unseelie Court has just": null, "done.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna turn to the Prince of the Unseelie Court and say,": null, "Captain Hob: Your majesty, for the respect I bear your court and your": null, "mother, her majesty the Queen of Air and Darkness, I would ask that any": null, "medics here be allowed to inspect his young majesty to make sure that he": null, "has not been addled by presence in the sun, for indeed we understand it\u2014": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Damn.": null, "Captain Hob: To interrupt a duel in progression besmirches the honor of": null, "the interrupter beyond the point where satisfaction may indeed be": null, "demanded from those of high society.": null, "Aabria: Wuvvy makes eye contact with you in this moment. What does she": null, "see?": null, "Omar: I think it's not necessarily what she sees in my eyes. It's more": null, "of the fucking cloud over my head grows three sizes [thunder clapping]": null, "and there are streaks of lightning going throughout the entire thing.": null, "Aabria: She buries her broadsword in the ground.": null, "Wuvvy:\u00a0I'll allow it.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Surena:\u00a0Oh.": null, "Wuvvy: He is my second and will replace me in the duel.": null, "Oscar: This is too much.": null, "Surena: Yeah, this is too much.": null, "Surena: Gwyndolin is pacing with her umbrella and her snacks.": null, "Brennan: Okay, so\u2014": null, "Chirp: Gwyndolin, tea?": null, "Gwyndolin: I'd love tea.": null, "Brennan: So I'm gonna look at Wuvvy and say,": null, "Captain Hob:\u00a0To be clear, my lady, you remove yourself from the request": null, "for satisfaction to be replaced by your second, who you now name as the": null, "Prince Andhera of the Unseelie Court.": null, "Wuvvy: I do.": null, "Captain Hob: Am I allowed to respond to this new challenge?": null, "Captain Hob: Very well. In the manner we are most accustomed to, I shall": null, "choose the weapon.

That does seem like what you said before.": null, "Chirp:\u00a0Yeah.": null, "Captain Hob: That's not at all what I said before.": null, "Captain Hob: This is the biggest stretch of a fuckin' lifetime. No, hold": null, "on, let's fuckin' examine this. Let's turn around. Listen, I mean, do": null, "you wanna warm up before a stretch this big? Because I'll tell you right": null, "now... I'll tell you right now, I'm also fine to choose the place if we": null, "would like to choose... I'll choose a place or I'll choose a weapon. If": null, "all of the rules are being cast aside.": null, "Wuvvy: I will set the new terms. One round.": null, "Andhera: Mm-hmm.": null, "Wuvvy: Swords. Just one.": null, "Andhera: Do blades count as different swords? This doesn't come apart,": null, "it's just...": null, "Surena: Oh my god.": null, "Andhera:\u00a0It has to, right?": null, "Wuvvy: It's wrestling now, it's wrestling.": null, "Andhera: No, are you serious?": null, "Wuvvy: Just wrestle. Yeah, whoever pins, one time to pin.": null, "Andhera:\u00a0Shit. Great. Great, thank you, my lady.": null, "Aabria: And she turns and walks off of the field.": null, "Andhera: Oh. So, Captain, where did we land on which weapon it would be?": null, "Is it still swords, is my understanding?": null, "Captain Hob: Let me understand, your majesty. You have come here to": null, "interrupt this duel. The Lady Wuvvy of the Court of Hoof and Claw has": null, "seen fit to prevent you from permanently ruining your honor, by allowing": null, "you to serve as her second. Do I understand that I am allowed, as that": null, "who is challenged, to decide the weapon of our duel?": null, "Andhera: Captain, I defer to you.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well. Then we shall respect the ancient laws of Fairy": null, "custom. I am glad to see. As I have stated previously for all to hear, I": null, "choose wrestling. Name a time and place.": null, "Andhera: We can go here, since you seem to be so enamored with rules.": null, "Oscar: Ooh, ooh.": null, "Chirp: Ooh.": null, "Brennan: I'm gonna turn to everyone and say,": null, "Captain Hob: Right here, right now?": null, "Andhera: Right here, right now.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well, the Prince of the Unseelie challenges a wounded": null, "man right here and now. Draw your weapon.": null, "Wuvvy: He is my second and is finishing what we have started.": null, "Captain Hob: Very well.": null, "Wuvvy: You could, of course, defer to yours.": null, "Brennan: I say,": null, "Captain Hob: Gorebladder, to be very clear, would wipe the floor with": null, "Brennan:\u00a0And I'm going to drop my halberd and square up.": null, "Oscar: Can I take this moment of like, just absolute\u2014": null, "Surena:\u00a0Chaos?": null, "Oscar: Chaos to do a Sending spell to Lady Featherfowl?": null, "Aabria: Yes. You can cast magic to each other.": null, "Aabria: Just don't interfere with the duel.": null, "Oscar: Great, so I'm sending her a message that says, in quotes,": null, "Rue:\u00a0\u201cRue's assistant?\u201d": null, "Oscar:\u00a0Question mark.": null, "Rue:\u00a0Why do this? You have hurt me deeply. Thought I was a friend.": null, "Emily: Lady Featherfowl's not gonna throw her cousin under the bus.

It seems": null, "we shall have a short revisit of the Battle of Briar Falls, where I will": null, "not commit the same mistake I did last time.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Ooooh.": null, "Lou: Just a silent nod.": null, "Brennan: It's gonna be a 19 initiative.": null, "Lou: This is dumb. This is stupid.": null, "Omar: Okay. It's gonna be plus zero, 4.": null, "[Aabria laughing] [group laughing]": null, "Oscar: [laughing] Oh\u00a0no, oh no.": null, "Aabria: Incredible.

If you can grapple him,": null, "the combat's over. You will pin him.": null, "Brennan: Cool.
