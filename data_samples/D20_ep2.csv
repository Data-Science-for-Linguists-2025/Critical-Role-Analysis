34318,100,Aabria,Aabria,unfathomable size. You've seen sparks and bits of lightning when Thorn,2,,,Burrow's End

34326,108,Rashawn,Rashawn,"tangible, or intangible, and that is very confusing to her. So I guess",2,,,Burrow's End

34357,139,Tula,Brennan," All right, so I think that that's a very worthy aspiration, and",2,,,Burrow's End
34358,140,Tula,Brennan,"that before that, we will probably have to find shelter from rain. We",2,,,Burrow's End
34359,141,Tula,Brennan,"will have to find food so that we do not go hungry, and there are a",2,,,Burrow's End
34360,142,Tula,Brennan,number of things that are very dangerous that are not creatures or,2,,,Burrow's End
34361,143,Tula,Brennan,monsters or the Blue. There are some very simple things that are,2,,,Burrow's End

34387,169,Thorn,Jasper,suggest we keep moving up to higher ground. I think the further away we,2,,,Burrow's End
34388,170,Thorn,Jasper,"can get from what's just happened, the better. But I open up to the",2,,,Burrow's End
