It's almost like": null, "I'm trying to Insight Thorn through you.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Fun.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0Because there's a fear I have that this is just about combining": null, "these two communities, and suddenly having half the people who live in": null, "the community revere Thorn, right?

So the monster's coming and we have to move?": null, "Viola:\u00a0There's\u2026": null, "Tula:\u00a0We don't know that there's a monster.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Right.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0We don't have to move, 'cause we can fight them!": null, "Lila:\u00a0And Uncle Walmer's going to be our dad?": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0What? Uncle Walmer can't be our dad, he sucks!": null, "Viola:\u00a0When did you start calling him uncle?": null, "Lila:\u00a0He's so old!": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0He's like two months older than you, Mum.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Uncle Walmer is not going to be anybody's dad. Or husband.": null, "Ava:\u00a0Well, we'll see about that.": null, "Tula:\u00a0No, if Uncle Walmer was going to make it happen, he would've made": null, "it happen by now.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Hello, he had a chance. He's not going to be with my sister, no.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Tula! [gestures with two hands, one at a much higher level than": null, "the other] Tula, Walmer!": null, "Ava:\u00a0You watch your tone, young ladies.": null, "Tula:\u00a0No one's trying to be disrespectful.": null, "Ava:\u00a0That's right!": null, "Tula:\u00a0I think tension is high, because it sounds like something very": null, "dangerous might be happening. [to Viola] Do you think that Thorn would": null, "want to come tomorrow and just explain what he's seen?": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Viola, you look up, and you actually make eye contact with": null, "Teedles, who is just like\u2026": null, "She mouths, \"I can go.\"": null, "Viola:\u00a0Yes, get him. Bring him here now.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0[whisper] Right now?": null, "Viola:\u00a0Yeah, we might as well talk it out now.": null, "Lila:\u00a0Oh my god, we're having an all-nighter.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0[whisper] They said in the morning.": null, "Tula:\u00a0We are not having an all-nighter. Wait, actually, what am I doing?": null, "Children, to bed.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0Aw, but everybody else is going to be here!": null, "Viola:\u00a0[whisper] In the morning.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0[whisper] Okay.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Well, you need rest if we're-": null, "Teedles:\u00a0[louder whisper] This is awkward, and I'm sad I was here.": null, "Ava:\u00a0[aggressively] Teedles!": null, "Teedles:\u00a0Oh!": null, "Ava:\u00a0Go!": null, "Tula:\u00a0I'm so sorry-": null, "Teedles:\u00a0Go where?": null, "Ava:\u00a0Go get him!": null, "Teedles:\u00a0Right now?": null, "Ava:\u00a0Right now!": null, "Teedles:\u00a0Why is everyone so mad?": null, "Ava:\u00a0Right now, we're having a little family discussion, and god help": null, "me, he's part of the family now, so he needs to be here. Kids, Jaysohn,": null, "you look at me! You look at me! You jump off another thing while I am": null, "around, and I swear to god! Emotional damage!": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0[cowering] Yes, Grandma.": null, "Tula:\u00a0Don't threaten Jaysohn with emotional damage.": null, "Ava:\u00a0Lila! You be a good girl and go to bed.": null, "Lila:\u00a0I think that it's only fair that if we have to move because a big": null, "monster is coming, that we should know why we're not safe in our home.": null, "Teedles:\u00a0[whisper] I'm going to come back in the morning. Okay, goodbye!": null, "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And she takes off.": null, "Tula:\u00a0I think that this would be better done in the morning. Is it all": null, "right if you get Thorn and come talk to us?": null, "Viola:\u00a0Absolutely, everybody go to bed. It's good to see you, my niece": null, "and nephew.": null, "Ava:\u00a0I'm not tired.": null, "[Aabria laughs.]": null, "Lila:\u00a0Me neither.": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0I'm not tired either. I'm never tired.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0And as this continued fight happens-": null, "Tula:\u00a0Can you help me?": null, "Ava:\u00a0[grumbles] All right. Okay, you kids come with Grandma.": null, "Siobhan:\u00a0 I'm up on a rock. I'm so high up.": null, "Ava:\u00a0Jaysohn!!": null, "Jaysohn:\u00a0I forgot, I forgot! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I forgot!": null, "Erika glares furiously.": null, "Jaysohn: [whisper] I forgot, I forgot, I forgot. I'm sorry, I forgot.": null, "Aabria: Do you climb down or do you jump down?": null, "Siobhan: I really, really slowly and carefully climb down.": null, "Ava: Climb down. Slowly. That's right. All right.": null, "Aabria: Everyone moves in their directions and settles down for the": null, "night. So we'll move from this discussion back to the Lukura, to Thorn": null, "Vale, alone. It's quiet. Everyone is either taking their shift watching": null, "or taking their shift sleeping. Your wife is gone, gone to speak with a": null, "family slightly more terrifying than even she is.": null, "Jasper: Yep.": null, "Aabria: And you are with your thoughts. Where do they go?": null, "Jasper: So, I think having had that moment earlier of slight panic with": null, "Viola being there, I think that Thorn is, much in the same way that he": null, "is imagining the family is expressing concerns as to his motivations, is": null, "also questioning himself, and probably won't really sleep that much": null, "because he's extremely aware of all of the lives of the people around": null, "him that he feels absolutely responsible for, and is going to\u2026 I'm going": null, "to basically try and listen to the forest. I want to track how the birds": null, "are flying and which direction they're flying, and if it feels odd or": null, "strange. I want to listen to the trees and see if they seem to be": null, "creaking more, if the wind seems to be picking up. Basically, get a": null, "sense of, as winter is rolling in and I have this sensation and feeling": null, "that I need to move, if that is coming from me, if that is an internal": null, "thing, or if that is an external thing, and that is the forest in fact": null, "telling me something.": null, "Aabria: Yeah.": null, "Jasper: Because I think that makes a big difference as to how he handles": null, "the next kind of thing.": null, "Aabria: Go ahead and give me a Survival check.": null, "Jasper:\u00a0Okay. [deep inhale] Can I cast Guidance on myself?": null, "Aabria: Yes.": null, "[radiant sound]": null, "Aabria: I love Guidance so much.": null, "[Jasper groans]": null, "[Erika gasps]": null, "Aabria: How'd you do?": null, "Jasper: Uh-huh, okay, cool, so I think Thorn's probably having a panic": null, "attack. That is a total of nine, but that was a one.": null, "Aabria: Oh!": null, "Erika: It was a nat one.": null, "Jasper: It was a nat one.": null, "Aabria: You've got to lead with that, my guy.": null, "Jasper: Yeah. But you see why I didn't, though, right? You see why I": null, "made the decision not to.": null, "Aabria: Totally fine.": null, "The dome fades to dark blue once again.": null, "Izzy: It wasn't just a complete failure, it was a 9, but\u2026": null, "Aabria: The thing that was going to happen next was going to require a": null, "Wisdom save, but I think we're just going to jump past that.": null, "Jasper: Cool. Hell yeah.": null, "[twittering birds and other animal sounds, then a loud, unnatural creak]": null, "Aabria: As you listen to the forest and feel yourself drift away from": null, "this moment and away from the natural things of the world, towards what": null, "you truly are, I think Thorn rejects a lot of the false divinity": null, "ascribed to you by your followers. But you do know, you have known for": null, "so long, that you are different.": null, "So when you say you go to listen to the forest, you can't help but slide": null, "away from your sense of self as the forest grabs you to speak. The": null, "seasons are changing, yes, but they always have. You've seen the full": null, "cycle of a year. The dread you feel has so much less to do with that": null, "than the other feelings, the sense of an oncoming storm. You are": null, "reminded, in fits and starts, and your mind flashes back to the moment": null, "where you received your scars. The beginning of your gifts. Your family": null, "calls it the Blue. You call it something closer to a meeting with\u2026 The": null, "word isn't quite there. It isn't a god, it isn't a monster, but": null, "something so large and unfathomable. You remember the petals kicking up": null, "from those blue flowers in the field. You remember making eye contact": null, "with something massive, and it regarding you back.": null, "But what you feel across your fur and deep in your gut is the grit of": null, "dust, sand, wind-blown and pushed and overtaking you, overtaking your": null, "camp, overtaking the Red Warren, felling the massive red oak tree and": null, "its crimson leaves that have guarded the people that you call family for": null, "generations.": null, "And when you wake up and come back to yourself, you realize that the": null, "night has passed. It is daytime. And looking out across the camp, the": null, "visibility is lower as a dust storm begins to pick up. You have minutes.": null, "Do you stay here to warn your people, or do you go to warn your person?": null, "The dome fades back to showing the tunnels of the warren.": null, "Thorn: Olliver, Teedles! Anybody!": null, "Aabria: Olliver and Teedles immediately move towards you, and they're": null, "kind of looking around like,": null, "Teedles: [coughs] It's kind of\u2026 Is it bad outside?": null, "Thorn: Okay, we don't have time. Enough. Whoever you can grab. Grab them": null, "and tell them to meet us by the Red Warren. Travel there as soon as you": null, "can. I just\u2026 Move! Do you understand me? Move!": null, "Aabria: Make an Intimidation check for me. I'll give you advantage.": null, "Jasper: Okay. That is going to be a total of 22.": null, "Aabria: Oh yeah.": null, "Thorn: [echoing] I said move!": null, "Aabria: And you see their ears flatten, and there's a moment of pure": null, "recognition. You have been in this formation before. This triangle has": null, "happened, and they understand immediately, and wordlessly turn and begin": null, "to scramble and rally everyone.": null, "Jasper: I beeline straight to the warren.": null, "Aabria: Sweet, I am going to need an Acrobatics check. It's not": null, "Survival, you know how to get to the Red Warren. That's not a problem.": null, "It's just, give me an Acrobatics. I'm going to say your DC is a 16.": null, "Jasper: Okay.": null, "Aabria: To make your way there.": null, "Jasper: Come on!": null, "Aabria: Quickly.": null, "Jasper: Oh my god.": null, "Izzy: Throw it away. Throw it away!": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you're going in the jail.": null, "Izzy: Put it in the trash.": null, "Aabria: What'd you get, bud?": null, "Jasper: I rolled a two for a total of seven.": null, "Aabria: You are extraordinarily capable. This is what you do. But you've": null, "never seen a dust storm before, and this loss of ability of easy": null, "breathing is strange and new, and it's taking you longer than expected": null, "to make your way back there.": null, "Jasper: I can feel, being far away from Viola as well, I can feel that": null, "anxiety is sitting [gestures around neck level] right up here, and in": null, "this moment, I'm not remembering my breathing. I think that's also": null, "contributing to missing of footing. Do you know what I mean? Stumbling.": null, "Aabria: 100%. We're going to cut back to the Red Warren. You're all": null, "underground. You wake up the next day bright and early, but there isn't": null, "anyone waiting for you as you get up. Ava, I think you're that level of": null, "old where you don't need a lot of sleep.": null, "Erika: Yeah, I'm an early bird. I get up as soon as-": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you're so close to death.": null, "Erika: Yeah, the early bird catches the hare.": null, "Aabria: That's very good. It's almost\u2026 Yes. What's your morning ritual?": null, "Do you tend to stay below, within the warren?": null, "Erika: Mm-hm, yes. Yes. Oh, well, you know, there are a couple things": null, "that need tending to, but usually, if it's a full house, then I'll go up": null, "and sort of be on my own a little bit. And then under the red\u2026 maple, I": null, "believe, yes?": null, "Aabria: Oak.": null, "Erika: I don't know trees.": null, "Aabria: It's a tree, who cares? You can't eat that.": null, "Erika: Yes.": null, "Aabria: As you come up and sort of peek above the warren under the shade": null, "of this massive tree, you see the dark red leaves under your feet,": null, "tamped down layers and layers of life and death and cycles here. You": null, "look out and see that the visibility here is a little murkier than you": null, "would expect without feeling all the sort of barometric changes that": null, "come with fog.": null, "Ava: My other eye is going too, isn't it? [sighs]": null, "Rashawn: It's cloudy out.": null, "Ava: That's what they say. When you hit four years old, everything": null, "starts going.": null, "Aabria: Go ahead and give me a Nature check.": null, "Erika: That's a 10.": null, "Aabria: Okay, yeah, you're looking around, and I think you take this": null, "sort of loss of visibility as an internal thing and not an external": null, "factor.": null, "Erika: Well, that's okay. I've still got my scent, and my memory, and my": null, "sense of touch, and my memory.": null, "[Brennan and Rashawn laugh]": null, "Brennan: Wow, straight Groucho. Incredible.": null, "Aabria: Incredible. And you're unaffected, until you see\u2026 A very small,": null, "sort of tawny-colored stoat with a big bite mark out of her left ear": null, "sort of pops into your view maybe three or four yards away and starts": null, "waving.": null, "Mila: Ma'am? Ma'am?": null, "Ava: Oh, hello...": null, "Mila: Mila.": null, "Ava: Mila, yes. Yes, Mila.": null, "Mila: \u00a0Hi, I was going\u2026 [stammers] I was on an errand\u2026": null, "Ava: You seem very anxious, Mila. Is something the matter?": null, "Aabria: You notice, I'm not even going to make you roll for it, you see": null, "that her right ear is sort of twitching, but not turning towards any": null, "information. Just, it seems like a strange tic that she's deeply unaware": null, "of.": null, "Mila: I was down over by the... [coughing] The river, and it's kind of\u2026": null, "It's hard to see, and I don't-": null, "Ava: Do you know, I think I might have something for that.": null, "Mila: For what?": null, "Ava: For your ear, your ear, dear.": null, "Mila: What's wrong with my ear?": null, "Aabria: She immediately grabs the other ear.": null, "Mila: It got bitten when I was little.": null, "Ava: No, no, no, the other one, although that's not optimal, I suppose.": null, "[Aabria coughs]": null, "Ava: I'm sorry, what was that about hard to see?": null, "Mila: I don't know. There's something happening. It's strange, it's kind": null, "of hard to breathe. Do you not see anything weird? [sniffing] Do you not": null, "smell that?": null, "[Erika sniffs]": null, "Erika: What do I smell?": null, "Aabria: Go ahead and give me a Perception check.": null, "Erika: 18.": null, "Aabria: Now give me a History check.": null, "Erika: Shit!": null, "Brennan: This is making me sad and scared.": null, "Aabria: Yay! We're doing it!": null, "Erika: 2.": null, "Aabria: Baby!": null, "Izzy: She doesn't know anything.": null, "Aabria: Baby girl doesn't know anything!": null, "Izzy: Has never known a thing.": null, "Erika: Sometimes it's really kind of a crapshoot, you know?": null, "[discordant music]": null, "Aabria: What you smell on the air is a sort of rock that you've come": null, "across times in your travels, broken up in weird, flat chunks that you": null, "can't find anywhere, but you find it in patches and batches in the": null, "woods. But there's always something wrong with it. It doesn't smell like": null, "wet mineral. It smells burnt and scorched and a little wrong and a": null, "little unnatural, and even though you can't place it, there's something": null, "familiar in that smell in the air that immediately drags you back": null, "towards, but not landing within, the worst day of your life. The first": null, "time you saw something that even you don't like talking about.": null, "[Erika sniffs again.]": null, "Mela: So you do smell it? [coughing]": null, "Ava: [thumps the table] Go find everybody that you know and gather at": null, "the warren, quickly!": null, "Aabria: She nods at you and blinks, and her eyes don't blink in sync,": null, "and you see a little bit of blood begins to come out of her nose.": null, "Izzy: [flinching back] What the heck?": null, "Jasper: Ohhh boy.": null, "Aabria: And she turns and runs and dives down into the warren.": null, "[music ends, players murmuring]": null, "Erika: I go back to the kids.": null, "Aabria: Yeah. You sort of follow her down, and we watch the split as she": null, "heads towards different knots and groupings of stoats within the Red": null, "Warren, and you immediately peel off towards where you left your family.": null, "You're older, you're very spry. You do notice, especially as you hear": null, "the difference in your footfalls as you split in directions, she's": null, "moving weirdly slowly, and you make your way back to your family, who's": null, "just beginning to rouse for the day. What do you do?": null, "[Rashawn yawns like she's waking up]": null, "Jaysohn: Grandma, have you ever killed a chicken?": null, "Tula: All right, kids. Everybody eat up.": null, "Izzy:\u00a0Lila's up making notes from everything she heard. Like the Charlie": null, "Day meme of the board. She's like, monster-": null, "Tula: Vi, we have jerky, but I also have some berries that are not good": null, "for the kids to eat. They're a little older, if you'd like some.": null, "Viola: [slyly] Oh, okay.": null, "Tula: Yeah, hey, I might have": null, "Ava: Tula, Viola! Come with me.": null, "[tense music]": null, "Tula: Uh\u2026 Kids, go help yourself to extra jerky.": null, "Jaysohn: Yes!": null, "Ava: Something is coming. Something terrible is coming.": null, "Viola: I told you something was coming.": null, "Aabria: Yes, well! You didn't, you were like, \"oh, vaguely something is": null, "happening!\" I mean right now!": null, "Aabria: [to Izzy] Give me a Stealth check.": null, "Brennan: I just hear my mom say \"right now,\" and I go over to Lila and": null, "Jaysohn, and-": null, "[Siobhan mimes throwing food in the air and catching it in her mouth.]": null, "Lila: [leaning forward] What's happening right now?": null, "Tula: What's happening right now is this. We're all going to stay": null, "together, because we're a family.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to touch both of them, and as I'm talking, I'm": null, "casting Bless on both of them and myself.": null, "Lila: The monster's coming.": null, "Jaysohn: Oh! [does a martial arts kata]": null, "Tula: Something's happening, and we're just going to all stay safe, and": null, "what's going to happen is we're going to keep our eyes up and we're": null, "going to keep our legs bent so that we can move fast if we need to,": null, "okay? Just listen to me and Grandma and Auntie Viola, okay?": null, "Aabria: Lila, Perception check.": null, "Izzy: Perception?": null, "Aabria: Mm-hm.": null, "Izzy:\u00a021.": null, "Aabria: Your mother is speaking close to you, and her words are filling": null, "your ears, but you can't help but notice the sound of a scream several": null, "tunnels away.": null, "[distant scream]": null, "Lila: Someone's screaming.": null, "Erika: Do I know of any safe spots nearby or in the warren?": null, "Aabria: Be more specific. What do you mean? Like, aboveground or within": null, "the warren?": null, "Erika: Aboveground, or within the network, the tunnel network.": null, "Aabria: This tunnel network is enough to comfortably house the amount of": null, "stoats that are here. It's why even when litters come through, it seems": null, "like this area can only support maybe fifty stoats at the most.": null, "Rashawn: You've got to eat a couple.": null, "Aabria: Yeah!": null, "Rashawn: To kind of make room.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to look at Mom and just say,": null, "Tula: How did you know something bad was happening? How did you find": null, "out?": null, "Ava: A little\u2026 Melissa. She came over and her ear was twitching in a,": null, "you know, very unfocused way. Something's wrong with her.": null, "Tula: What did she say was happening bad?": null, "Ava: She said she couldn't see and everything.": null, "Tula: Where?": null, "Erika rolls a die.": null, "Ava: Down by the river.": null, "Aabria: [laughing] Did you roll for your own memory?": null, "Brennan: My instinct in this moment is, I know where the river is, I": null, "know where the warren is, and I'm going to take my family and run away": null, "from the river, from the warren. Something bad is happening at the": null, "river. I'll take my odds that something not-bad is happening at": null, "not-the-river.": null, "Aabria: Sweet. Not-the-river would be in the direction of Thorn and": null, "where your sister stay.": null, "Tula: We need to find Thorn.": null, "Rashawn: I pop my head out and I yell,": null, "Viola: [elongated] Thorn!!": null, "Jasper straightens in his seat.": null, "Thorn: My wife!": null, "Erika: Somewhere, somehow.": null, "Brennan: I sense that my wife is screaming my name at the top of her": null, "lungs.": null, "Rashawn: I mean, if he's at all within 30 feet of me, to cast Sanctuary": null, "on him.": null, "Aabria: He's not that close, because that would require\u2026 The equivalent.": null, "All of your spells and all of your abilities are being sort of scaled": null, "down to stoat scale, so 30 feet to a stoat would honestly be very, very": null, "far, if we're holding that number. But you do pop your head above": null, "ground, and you see that yeah, it looks almost like a fog's rolling in.": null, "But it's gray, and the air, the sky isn't wet, it's dry. It's as though": null, "dirt, utterly devoid of water, is sort of filling in and filtering": null, "through the air.": null, "[fearful music]": null, "Rashawn: As I am trying to not fully open my eyes, because they're a": null, "little obscured with the dirt, I just let out some sort of [chittering]": null, "to see if he can hear where I am, sort of like an echolocation type": null, "thing.": null, "Viola: Where are you, Thorny? Thorny!": null, "Aabria: We'll make this a full luck check, and I'm going to make- No,": null, "no, not for you.": null, "Rashawn stops reaching for her dice.": null, "Aabria: The lucky roller's going to roll it.

Low\u2026 We'll": null, "talk about it.": null, "Jasper: 17. [exhales]": null, "Aabria: With a\u00a017, you hear that first shout of \"Thorn,\" and you realize": null, "that somehow, you haven't noticed how much visibility you've been": null, "losing, and you were actually running just a little bit south of where": null, "you should be headed, and you realign and head in her direction. [to": null, "Rashawn] And sort of emerging murkily out of whatever this strange": null, "atmosphere is, you see Thorn sprinting as fast as his little feet will": null, "carry him towards you.

I throw him over my back, if I can, and I": null, "just burrow deeper, deeper back into the warren, underground.

We're all together.": null, "Brennan: We're all together, yeah.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Okay.": null, "Thorn: Stay. Stay here. [coughs]": null, "Rashawn, with an alarmed expression, begins fanning the air.": null, "Thorn: I don't know what it is in the air, but it's incredibly hard to": null, "breathe out there.

It feels like my lungs are on": null, "fire.": null, "Brennan: I would like to make a check. Listening to my sister, I want to": null, "make a check to know if there is a tunnel that is not connected to the": null, "other tunnels that is maybe newer or fresher or weaker.": null, "Rashawn: One of the tunnels we dug as children.": null, "Brennan: Yeah, like a small play tunnel.": null, "Aabria: Well, here's a real- [pauses thoughtfully]": null, "Erika: We don't dig tunnels.": null, "Aabria: That's the thing. I would allow that children might think to dig": null, "tunnels. But the fun fact about the warren that you live in: you didn't": null, "build that. Your mothers' mothers' mothers didn't build that. This was": null, "wrested away from a family of rabbits. Rabbits tunnel, and you consume.": null, "Ava: Ah, yes. The Curtises. Mm.": null, "Aabria: The Curtises?!": null, "Jasper: Gave them a name.": null, "Aabria: You gave them names as you were eating them.": null, "Brennan: Mr. Curtis was delicious.": null, "Aabria:\u00a0Wild.": null, "Rashawn: Hare Curtis. What a man.": null, "Aabria: But you know what, give me just a general Luck check to see if a": null, "little joke set of tunnels that you guys made as children would have": null, "survived to now.": null, "Brennan: That's a 5.": null, "Aabria: You don't think the tunnel's there anymore. You think the": null, "turning of weather and the subsequent months since you were children has": null, "washed and eroded all of that away. But you do realize, as you go and": null, "look in that direction, that this dust, though it's sort of overtaking": null, "everything, is coming from the southeast. There's a directionality to": null, "this.": null, "Brennan: Do I sense that running is the better plan here? That my first": null, "instinct is better? That we should try to get away from this?": null, "Aabria: Give me a Survival check.": null, "Brennan: Okay. That's a 2.": null, "Rashawn: Wowzers.": null, "Brennan: 2\u00a0plus 6 is 8.": null, "Aabria: There's a sense of panic here, because if you think of this like": null, "weather, there's no sense of outrunning weather. You just sort of hunker": null, "down and wait it out. And then as you're sort of in the air and sniffing": null, "and trying to figure out what this is, there is something so deeply": null, "unnatural in this, in the wind, that even with that low roll, you can't": null, "let go of the fact that your instinct isn't \"Get low and get safe,\" it's": null, "\"Get away.\"": null, "Tula: There's nowhere to hide. There's no tunnel that we can close. The": null, "air will find us. We have to run.": null, "Thorn: Do you have a sense of direction, or-": null, "Tula: Yes. Follow me.": null, "Brennan: And I'm going to peel off. I'm maintaining concentration": null, "on the Bless on my kids, but I'm looking, I'm making sure that Mom is": null, "not slower than-": null, "Aabria: Well, everyone's going to make a Con save. Tula, you're going to": null, "make it with advantage, and Lila and Jaysohn are making this with": null, "disadvantage, along with Ava.": null, "Siobhan: 8.": null, "Aabria: 8, okay.": null, "Brennan: 22.": null, "Aabria: 22. You're fine.": null, "Rashawn: 14.": null, "Aabria: Ava?": null, "Erika: 21.": null, "Izzy: 19.": null, "Aabria: 19.": null, "Izzy: Oh, actually, 21.": null, "Aabria: Nice.": null, "Rashawn: The kids are all right.": null, "Aabria: [shrugs] They're kind of all right.": null, "Siobhan: I have immediately run away from the group, climbing a tree,": null, "just doing stupid shit while the grownups talk, because I got bored.": null, "Aabria: Viola, you're going to take 4 points of damage. [to Siobhan] You": null, "take 11.": null, "[players groan]": null, "Jaysohn: [coughing] It smells bad out here!": null, "Aabria: And as you feel your lungs sort of begin to freeze up, it gets a": null, "little quieter up here, and I think you begin to hear the yelling down": null, "below within the warren.": null, "[faint echoing screams and shouts]": null, "Aabria: As you look down, you guys see that this dust, it's in the air": null, "and hazy here, but it's definitely lying low enough that it's beginning": null, "to pour into the warren, and you're beginning to hear more screams and": null, "thuds.": null, "Jasper: Having seen something potentially similar to this, do I recall": null, "this having an effect on creatures?": null, "Aabria: Give me a History check, or Arcana.": null, "Jasper: Let's go with\u2026 They're both bad. That's a 16, for a 15. Hey.": null, "Aabria: Okay, which one are you going for?": null, "Jasper: I will go with, I think Arcana is more in his wheelhouse.": null, "Aabria: That's good, because the DCs were different. You're not": null, "remembering something, but you're realizing the connection between them.": null, "You can smell that strange sort of ozone in this wind, in this haze, in": null, "this dust, and you recognize that it's connected to all of this, but": null, "this is nothing like anything you've ever seen before, until you smell": null, "something that was in the wind on the night that you first saw them. It": null, "was coming off of their clothing. You remember the squeak that": null, "accompanied with, and you've never smelled anything like that.": null, "Siobhan: Can I do a Perception check to see if climbing, if the smoke is": null, "going down, would climbing help us?": null, "Aabria: Yeah, please do. Make it with advantage. What a good instinct.": null, "Siobhan: Okay, 24.": null, "Aabria: Amazing. Even as you're kind of trying to get your own shit": null, "together, and you begin to feel a little trickle of blood at your nose": null, "and at your ear, you have that sense to run and to get to high ground,": null, "absolutely.": null, "Jaysohn: Let's get up the tree! Let's go up the tree!": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn, it's not a good time to climb right now.": null, "Jaysohn: Let's go up- No, look, the smoke is going down! We should go": null, "up!": null, "[Izzy screams]": null, "Brennan: I see that my-": null, "Aabria: Do you just scream?": null, "Izzy: There's blood coming out of his face!": null, "Brennan: I'm going to Lay on Hands-": null, "[Jaysohn snorting as he wipes his nose, laughter from Aabria]": null, "Brennan: -and I'm going to heal you for 11 points of damage, and then": null, "I'm going to say,": null, "Tula: All right, it's time to climb! We're going to climb! We're all": null, "going to climb.": null, "The dome fades back to dark blue.": null, "Jasper: Do I know if there's any high ground, actual high ground nearby?": null, "Obviously the tree is an option, but if I'm thinking something's": null, "potentially moving this way, I don't necessarily want to be in the trees": null, "as they roll through. Do I know of any hillocks or a potentially high": null, "ground that we could climb and actually be high in terms of-": null, "Aabria: Yeah, you hear the \"Get high,\" and you realize that running to": null, "the northwest will send you back towards your camp. Running dead west": null, "will lead you to where the ground begins to grade and steeply move": null, "uphill.": null, "Jasper: Okay, I will mark the tree with anything that Olliver or Teedles": null, "might recognize, and I'll basically keep doing that in the direction": null, "that we're going so that if they do get here, they'll know which way we": null, "went.": null, "Aabria: Okay.": null, "Jasper: And then I'll turn around and say,": null, "Thorn: High ground is a good option, but I think we should do high": null, "ground rather than just high in the trees. I don't know, but something": null, "could be coming, and we don't want to be here when it gets here, so": null, "let's head this way.": null, "Tula: Yeah. Yeah.": null, "Jasper: And I'll probably lead off, assuming I have high-ish Survival.": null, "Siobhan: I also have high Survival.": null, "Brennan:\u00a0I have six.": null, "Jasper: Oh, perfect. Okay, yeah.": null, "Thorn: Brighter than the sun, swifter than the wind.": null, "Jasper: And I'll give you Guidance.": null, "Aabria: He just yells cult shit at you, and you feel a little bit better": null, "about what's happening.": null, "Brennan: Sorry, do I have the highest Survival? I just want to make": null, "sure.": null, "Siobhan: I have seven. I have plus seven to Survival.": null, "Rashawn: I have plus zero, so yeah, you're in charge, big sis.": null, "Brennan: Okay. Sensing that Jaysohn-": null, "Jasper: Jaysohn's faster, as well.": null, "Siobhan: Yeah, I'm so fast.": null, "Brennan: Also, Jaysohn just nailed it. So I think as you're about to": null, "give that to me, I'm going to look and say,": null, "Tula: Jaysohn.": null, "Jaysohn: Yeah?": null, "Tula: Can you focus and lead us out of here?": null, "Jaysohn: Yes! Yes! I can lead us out of here!": null, "Siobhan: I just run so fast that you can barely see me in front of you.": null, "Thorn: Brighter than the sun, swifter than the wind!": null, "Jasper: I'll give you Guidance.": null, "Izzy: Can I make an Investigation check?": null, "Aabria: Ooh, what are you looking for?": null, "Izzy: What this is, clues of what this is.": null, "Aabria: Yeah, give me an Investigation check.": null, "Izzy: Nat 1. I don't know anything. Forget it. Cut it out.": null, "Aabria: [laughs] We're not going to. That's so important. The thing that": null, "you get from here isn't somehow you misreading the situation. This is": null, "different than anything you've ever experienced. It starts with a tickle": null, "and then becomes more of a burr, because you Lila, you know so much, and": null, "you care, and you're able to put things together. You've scraped": null, "together an understanding of how this warren works, and maybe what's": null, "happened to your family over the years, and yet this is the blank. This": null, "is the thing that everyone that knows anything has been keeping from you": null, "for your entire life, and you can't figure it out. This is scary, but it": null, "doesn't make sense that everyone who has control over every situation is": null, "this scared. It's because they know something that you don't know that": null, "they refuse to tell you, so you run. Is there anything else you wanted": null, "to do?": null, "Izzy: No.": null, "Aabria: Okay. Is everyone sprinting after Jaysohn?": null, "Erika: Before I go, I would like to just, hope against hope, poke my": null, "head back into underground and see-": null, "Izzy: No, don't do that. Don't do that, don't do that. No, no, don't do": null, "that.": null, "Erika: Is there anyone?": null, "Izzy: No, no.": null, "Erika: Is there anyone that can make it out with us?": null, "Aabria: You look down into the tunnels, and you see a surprising number": null, "of bodies. Anyone within maybe three generations of you is down. Anyone": null, "that's your grandchildren's age or younger is down, and the ones that": null, "are left are scrambling, they are frantic, and you make eye contact with": null, "Walmer, who is pushing this massive, scraped-off bit of bark who is": null, "pushing this massive, scraped-off bit of bark from the tree above you": null, "that's looked out for you for so long, and is preparing to push it": null, "against the opening to seal themselves down to try to keep it out, and": null, "he reaches and beckons for you.": null, "Walmer: Come! Come on!": null, "Ava: No, I've got to protect my family.": null, "Walmer: That's what I'm trying to do. So get down here so we can block": null, "off this tunnel. We'll be safe.": null, "Ava: There's no hiding from this. There's no hiding from the Blue.": null, "Walmer: What are you saying? The Blue? No, it's\u2026 That's a tale that we": null, "tell to children to get them to sleep at night. You need to come down": null, "here now, Ava!": null, "Thorn: Ava, come on. Everyone's going. You know what's coming!": null, "Walmer: Ava, get the fuck down here!": null, "Ava: Goodbye, Walmer.": null, "Erika: And I start running after them.": null, "Aabria: You see maybe one or two people that like and respect you": null, "looking their heads in your direction, and Walmer pushes them back and": null, "seals the warren. They're going to wait it out. Anyone else doing": null, "anything else?": null, "Jasper: I'll just, if I can, be last in the group, because I want to": null, "make sure that if anyone falls behind, I'll try and help, and then I'm": null, "just gonna be trying to mark every tree that I'm close to with that same": null, "symbol so if they come through this way, they'll know which direction": null, "we've headed.": null, "Brennan: I'd like to give a help action to my son.": null, "Aabria: Ooh.": null, "Brennan: Because we've got the Guidance here. I'd like to give a help": null, "action, which is, I think\u2026 Any time, as Jaysohn's leading us to higher": null, "ground, something more interesting pops up, I think I'm just going to": null, "chime in with a,": null, "Tula: How high do you think it'll go, Jaysohn? How high will the high": null, "ground get?": null, "Jaysohn: I think it'll get really high! Look at how high I'm getting": null, "right now! Look at how high that bit is!": null, "Siobhan enthusiastically mimes climbing.": null, "Aabria: Incredible.": null, "Rashawn: Fastest boy alive.": null, "Aabria: Give me a Survival check with advantage. That's brilliant.": null, "Siobhan: Oh, thank god for that advantage. Survival plus 7, so 25\u2026 28.": null, "[players ooh and snap with appreciation]": null, "Erika: Wow!": null, "Aabria: [whisper] Incredible.": null, "Jasper: We! Are! Surviving!": null, "Aabria: Jaysohn, you are leading this group, and you realize as you": null, "pass, as you're noticing all of these things, that you're further than": null, "you've ever been in the woods, and you're running, and then eventually,": null, "as the air begins to thin out and clear a little bit, see other animals": null, "also fleeing out from where all of this dust is beginning to settle, and": null, "even though your lungs are burning, you feel them start to loosen up a": null, "little bit as the air gets clearer. You lead them up to high ground, to": null, "the top of this beautiful hill.": null, "You all arrive exhausted, but the air is clear, and you can see the sun": null, "again. You see animals continuing to sprint in wild directions. All of": null, "you can look back, and through the haze and mire, you see this little": null, "vale that was your home just through the very thick of where all of this": null, "is pooling, all this dust is settling, more like soup than like dust, a": null, "little bit of red of the tree that's looked over your home for longer": null, "than any of you can remember, since before your kind had memory. And you": null, "see nothing of your home.": null, "Those of you that know where to look and how to look see creatures that": null, "did not make it high enough fast enough, slowing down, getting lost to": null, "the dust, to the fog, to the Blue, to the whatever that is. But you are": null, "here, and you're safe, and you're together.": null, "Thorn, go ahead and give me an Investigation check as you look out in": null, "the direction of the Lukura.": null, "Jasper: Three.": null, "Aabria: Bro. We are trying to tell a story here.": null, "Rashawn: You're making me look bad in front of my family.": null, "Jasper: [American accent] Hey, listen. We're going to have a chat, okay?": null, "Rashawn: I put a lot of faith in you, brother. Come on.": null, "Jasper: I'm sorry!": null, "Aabria: You see the edge of the woods where the Lukura have been": null, "encamped for weeks and weeks longer than you've ever been stopped before": null, "is also swallowed and lost to that. You strain your eyes trying to look": null, "for your friends, your people, and you can't make anything out. Then you": null, "hear...": null, "Teedles: Boss? [coughs] Boss?": null, "Aabria: And behind you, you see Olliver, you see Teedles, and you see,": null, "scampering back and away from them, a contingent, no more than eight or": null, "nine, of faces that you recognize. Several of them are not stoats, and": null, "you see something\u2026 No, I'm going to make you roll for it.": null, "Jasper: Are you sure? It's going really well for me today, so-": null, "Aabria: It's going so good.": null, "Jasper: It would be so fun if I don't have to roll.": null, "Aabria: You can cast Guidance on yourself.": null, "Jasper: Okay, yeah, I'm going to do this-": null, "Aabria: I think you need the help.": null, "Rashawn: I'll Bless you.": null, "Jasper: [whisper] Thank you.": null, "Rashawn: Honey.": null, "Jasper: [imitating Rashawn] You're making me look bad.": null, "Aabria: I need you to make an Animal Handling check to see what's going": null, "on.": null, "Jasper: If it would help, because I feel like I need it right now-": null, "Aabria: Yeah, sure.": null, "Jasper: Can I cast Speak With Animals on myself? Can I basically try and": null, "further my understanding-": null, "Aabria: Sure, I'll allow that. You can make your check with advantage,": null, "then, in this moment.": null, "Aabria: Did you roll two digits?": null, "Jasper: Yeah, yeah I did! I managed it.": null, "Aabria: Oh, good job, buddy.": null, "Jasper: Okay, so 17. Wait, what was this? This was Animal Handling?": null, "Aabria: Animal Handling.": null, "Jasper: Oh, 21.": null, "Aabria: 21. There's something very strange and sort of profound": null, "happening here and now, because you realize you want to reach out and": null, "call out to creatures, followers that listen to you, and you're suddenly": null, "aware like a vertigo pan of the divide between your Beacons and the": null, "stoats that are here in your family and the animals that are animals in": null, "this moment, who don't have a sense of follow the leader but simply flee": null, "and survive. You see the badger sprinting away, eyes wild. You see the": null, "pine martens and some of the birds that were with you scattering and": null, "scampering away, and sort of putting it together with the look on": null, "Olliver and Teedles' faces, they seem exhausted and sort of resigned to": null, "no longer keeping this group together. That in the face of a mortal": null, "threat, an animal will do what an animal needs to do, and some of those": null, "other stoats don't seem to be hanging back to take their orders from": null, "you. They move higher and farther away. But Olliver and Teedles are": null, "different. They were your Beacons for a reason, and they stand here": null, "breathless, confused, but ready to serve.": null, "Teedles: Are you okay? [coughing]": null, "Thorn: As many of us that could made it out of the warren. You did well.": null, "Teedles: Others\u2026 We were able to tell\u2026 Most people, they just kind of\u2026": null, "We didn't\u2026 No one really knew what to do, so everyone broke in different": null, "directions.": null, "Thorn: Yes. It's unlike anything we've seen before. If it wasn't for the": null, "family, I'd probably be lost myself.": null, "Ava: Jaysohn, you did very, very well.": null, "Thorn: You were impressive, Jaysohn.": null, "Erika: And I pull out a little hard, dried strawberry, and I hand it": null, "over to him.": null, "She hands a strawberry candy across the table to Siobhan.": null, "Aabria: [laughing] Oh my god, you have a Werther's!": null, "Aabria: Incredible. Inspiration.": null, "Brennan: I look at Viola and I go-": null, "Tula: Did we ever get candy? We never got candy.": null, "Viola: She never, ever, ever gave us anything.": null, "Ava: [to Lila] You could learn a little something from your brother.": null, "Viola: She would brush us backwards. You know, the hair grows one way,": null, "and she'd just go against the grain.": null, "Tula: And she's say, that's how you have to get under the fur, to really": null, "get it clean.": null, "Viola: Terrible.": null, "Siobhan: [speaking around the candy] I'm so happy.": null, "Viola:\u00a0Those followers\u2026 They should've known to follow the Beacons. They": null, "should've known that when we are not around- [catching herself] When": null, "Thorn is not around-": null, "Thorn: \"We,\" it's fine.": null, "Viola: \"We,\" thank you. When we are not around, they are to take your": null, "lead. That is very disappointing.": null, "Teedles: It's okay, most of\u2026 Most of the people [coughing] who followed": null, "you came from other encampments. We follow you both, because we believe": null, "in you, but they have families too. And I think if they ran, it was": null, "because they hoped to save them, and I can't begrudge them for that.": null, "Thorn: Everyone was doing what they had to do to survive, and that is": null, "understandable, but I owe you all an apology. I had this feeling, this": null, "sense. I knew something was coming, and I should've...I should've": null, "pressed the issue last night. I hesitated. And that is exactly what I": null, "want everyone not to do. It won't happen again, and I apologize. You did": null, "well.": null, "Teedles: So you know what this is?": null, "Thorn: No, I don't know what this is, but I had a feeling something was": null, "coming, and then by the time I awoke this morning, it was too late.": null, "Teedles: So where now?": null, "Thorn: That's a very good question. [looking to the side] Sorry, I was": null, "off-put. Jaysohn's\u2026 Are you\u2026 It's so loud, the way you-": null, "Jaysohn: The seeds are really crunchy.": null, "[all laughing]": null, "Thorn: Really. Sorry, I was just in a moment, really thinking hard, and": null, "I can sort of, you know\u2026": null, "[Siobhan loudly crunches her candy.]": null, "Thorn: Like, it was so close to my ears.": null, "Aabria: Oh my god.": null, "Tula: Thank you very much for the strawberry.": null, "Ava: Well, he did good.": null, "Brennan: I'm going to turn over to Jaysohn and say,": null, "Tula: I'm so proud of you.": null, "Jaysohn: Thanks, Mom.": null, "Tula: I've only ever seen one stoat run that fast.": null, "Jaysohn: Who? \u2026Oh! [whisper] Dad!": null, "Aabria: In this beautiful moment, you begin to climb up the nearest": null, "tree, and you can take your time and be careful, and you can look out": null, "and see that the clearest air, the clearest path, is in the direction": null, "that you've been running, and that all of the land back and away has": null, "been overtaken by this dust. Give me one more Perception check.": null, "Rashawn: 20. Dirty 20.": null, "Aabria: Nice. Everything makes sense, if you can just get a little": null, "perspective. You see that all of this dust, this choking wind, is": null, "originating from a path that you've never noticed before, because you": null, "were always too close to it. Inside it, something that looks like a": null, "river, but gray, that winds through the trees and down far away, past": null, "where you can see because of the horizon, because of the dirt, because": null, "of that atmosphere, that something or a group of somethings approaching": null, "with the wind at its back has been blowing all of that acrid air towards": null, "you.

No!": null, "Tula: Stay here!": null, "Brennan: Dive.": null, "Ava: Young lady, you put that tongue back in your mouth.": null, "Aabria: [chitters] Folds it back into its mouth.": null, "Ava: Do you speak stoat?": null, "[Aabria squeaks]": null, "Ava: Be better!": null, "[Aabria laughs]": null, "Viola: Yeah, I was really hoping that we would tell you this when you": null, "were much older.
